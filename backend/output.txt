Alright, so we'll go ahead and get started because we got a lotto do today which we hold most days.Um a few things I tend to, when I get excited, talk fast,that tends to work okay for the native english speakers and notalways great for the non native english speakers.If you start to have problems with my pronunciation, hearingme, I work pretty hard to make myself clear, microphone helps.But if you are struggling you can tell me right away, justraise your hand and say something.If that's something you don't wanna do, which is perfectlyreasonable. You can talk to me after class.I will in general be available after class almost all days.Um after this class so I teach ninenoon and 1 30 so between noon and 1 30 class there won't be awhole lot of time. I think they're all in thisroom. Um but I'll be around to talk topeople if you've got questions and stuff like that pseudooffice hours, I won't usually do project stuff and things likethat, but any lecture material, administration issues, stufflike that, perfectly fair game after class.What else?I think that's it.So again, if you have problems understanding me or hearing me,please let me know.I normally talk really loudly and I tend not to like usingmicrophones, but as I said, I'm lecturing for six hours today soI'm gonna try not to yell too much.There are three of us teaching.So myself uh Jonathan Beaumont uh Chris Lattnerum and we're interesting group of folks uh Jonathan is actuallyteaching for#####70. Also this term.Uh he was actually my Gs I for 4 70 back in the day we hired him.He's great. Um Chris, as I said, he's nevertaught before uh to my knowledge, I'm pretty surethat's true,But he's gonna have a great and different set of insights andthe rest of us because we're both career academics.I worked at Intel for two years. But that's about it.Chris has done like I said, VP at arm, which is a you guysgonna be learning the armed programming language.So it's a pretty relevant company will have almost all ofyou. I would guess 98% of you arecarrying an armed process around you right now.Um High degree of probability, that's right on your phone if noplace else.Um And he's also done a startup and done some other things.So it'll be interesting to see how that goes.I'm really looking forward to working with him.UmSo who am Iuh dr Mark rehab. I've been here for 22 years,started in uh 2000.I taught a lot of different things.This is Engine 100. Engine 101.I was hired to teach 203 and 3 70 to 70 to 81 I've titled.It's been a long time for that. 3 73 which is embedded systemstheory of computer science, signal processing, computerarchitectureand the class I taught last semester is advanced embeddedsystems, which is an MD. For doing hardware things.As a note, the computer scientists in the room.These classes are weirdly computer science courses.You can use them as your M. D.Although it's harder than pretty much any C.S.#####M.D. And it's one of the 300 levelclass that counts as an upper level electives.So if you want to do stuff with hardware, CS actually allowsthat. And those classes you have room,partly because a lot of work. But yeah,sothere's me in a nutshell, I think.So, graduating phds from MSU.This is a um prehistoric reference is a reference to aprehistoric meme. Anybody recognize the memetoo old for you guys.The original members. All your base are belong to usis one of the earliest memes that actually came around in thecomputer age. That's not quite true.But in the modern computer age. And then this is a Linuxeyes version of it. As a command that says to makeall of your base. Everything in the base directorybecome owned by us. And then this is auh you guys will know what this is the next few weeks becausethat's gonna be computer architecture stuff.Alright, so yeah, there you go. Other miscellaneous things aboutme. Let's see.I am a board gamer. I own approximately 200 boardgames, which is my clique of friends puts me in the very veryvery small side of the world. One of my sets of friends,married couple, no kids, one dog have I think they're north of100 and 501,200 board games. So I'm also a role playing gamerplay pickleball. I played ultimate frisbee formsu.Um Yeah that's kind of me.So still playplay Ultimate like twice a year now, believe it or not.We have a huge student staff. These are the G.S. I.S. You may go that's not#####that much.Well those are the I. S.So we got a lot of folks um they're all experienced, they'veall done through 70 before.Um And so I'm looking forward to working at this group.It should be a lot of fun.Class resources. We have a website.I think I have the U. R.L. For the website.Almost positive. It's not the one I use butbecause the one I use is the one that redirects it.UmIf you have exam, accommodation stuff.SSD things and things like that, we have to fill out our formrather than we don't use the university system.So please make sure you do that. There's some deadlines and stuffon the website. Uh But there's everything ispretty much the course. Home page should be a link toeverything.We're using piazza. You should be able to get fromthe cross website. But there it is.Uh It's already been used? I think my favorite part is thatthe first post meme is back? I guess that's an old old old oldthing. Um I hadn't seen it for a whilein piazzagrade scope.I'll be using to turn in assignments in the like, I don'tknow if you guys are on grade scope yet, but if you are, youwill be today. So I think that I think they didit last night but I haven't checked.Whoops when an extra pages to goany administrative things with that.I don't think that should be too surprising.Okay.UmSo we're gonna be looking at a bunch of different things inthis class. Alright.Today is gonna be mostly your standard course introduction,which is#####I usually just start giving serious lecture butyou're early and I squeeze some into the lecture.But, contact setting for this class I think is particularlyimportant. Alright.Actually introduced myself. I should have had you guysintroduce yourselves. How many of you are? Computerscience L. S.A.Computer science engineering.Computer engineering.What you going to joinmori's and sees that's weird. Maybe even get up early in themorning. UmOtherwhat do we got?Ahother goodJaime Sommerspsychology, anybody else?Me? All right.I usually try to throw my computer engineers in any 250s.So there's you know president for having this crossdisciplinary stuff.Sohow many of you have taken?Um how many of you have taken and finished? 2 81.Okay. How many of you are currentlytaking to anyone?All right. How many of you have not takenand are not taking to anyone?All right. A couple of comments on that.If you barely skated through to 80 on the programming side,Okay,you're probably gonna find the programming side of this to be astruggle. Not impossible, not undoable.Just be prepared.I view to 80 and 2 81 as the equivalent of english classes.What do I mean by that? They teach you how to write, how todo the thing, how to present your ideas in english or in Cplus plus in that case makes sense.There's classes like an econ class where you have to writepapers sometimes. Okay.If your english is garbage and you can't write, no matter howwell you understand the econ information,you can't present it in a paper. You agreeIf you can't write the can't clearly rightat the same time, you#####can be a great writer and know nothingabout economic paper. You can be on your way throughit, but it's gonna be pretty obvious to anybody knows whatthey're doing. You agreeWe are very similar to that the 280 level background issufficient for the programming in this class.Except for the things that it's not.We'll teach those. Okay.However, if you are a great programmer or you know, you'reat the 2 80 barely skated through the programming level ofprogramming. You're gonna be like that persontaking econ class who's not very good at english.You're gonna be struggling with two things.The econ notion, computer architecture notions and puttingit down on paper so that it works.We use programming languages, programming C.In this case, I know you all know C Plus plus, we're using C.We use programming as a way for you to show you understand thematerial. Just like an econ prof would dowith a paper. Make good sense if you can'texpress it well, you're in some trouble.Doesn't make it unbearable. No, you do the same thing andnon native english speaker might do in an econ class with papers,go in for help, we'll start working early, etcetera.Make good sense.Those of you have gotten through to 81.The programming side should not be your issue if you did well,in 280 programming side should not be your issue.If you barely got through to 80 could be one of the issues yousuffer. Okay.And doing both at the same time is rough.Alright. Make good sense.Um a couple other comment. Well, I'll do the#####other commentswhen I get to it. So we're gonna be doing a lot ofdifferent things.I want to kind of see how you guys were.Uh but let me jump over to this again, goals of the course,instruction set architecture, which is understanding basicallythe interface between the software and the hardware.There's an interface. I love the word interface.I love the notion of an interface.You guys have that idea from programming.Computer scientists don't understand the idea of aninterface better than almost anyone.Okay. You got some function calls youcan make right, that's an interface.There's two sides to an interface.There's a side where you're using it, the side where youwrote it. You agree.And in between this really should be thought of as aspecification.Okay. I can write the specificationabstract, li with neither an implementation nor a use.You agreeif I do it well, I can do that. It's pretty cool.But I need to think about both sides the implementation and theuse, I wanna make it easy for the users, but I'll make theimplementation viable and efficient.Make good sense.The instruction set architecture is the interface betweenprograms and the hardware. We want to make it bothbuildable, which is we're gonna be focusing on this class andreasonable for programs to useprocessor. Micro architecture is a littlebit different.That's gonna be on the implementation side.So this is the interface,this is the implementation in hardwaremakes senseto be doing that.Now, it turns out there's really two main parts to micro.There's really three main parts of micro architecture.We're gonna cover two in this class.Okay. One#####is the architecture that isthat which these two things combined knows they both havethe word architecture in it. Often when somebody saysarchitecture sometimes I mean this sometimes I mean sometimesthey mean both cope in this case.I mean both. Okaythe architectureand the particular micro architecture the implementationis part of the system but the other part is getting thememory. You guys all know what memory isyou've worked with in some extent with the rays withvariables and stuff like that. We're gonna be getting a muchdeeper understanding of memory in this class.Okay. So I said there's three mainparts that's this that's this memory.The other part of the thing we're not gonna cover.So you know is often called this is sometimes called the core ofthe processor. The cash, the memory system.And there's another part sometimes called the encoreWhich is like how does it actually talk to your keyboardand stuff like that? That's more 3 73 stuff.Okay well barely barely barely well wave on it as it goes by atbest. Okay.There's a lot of wackiness thereand then the whole system. Architecture putting it alltogether is what you can think about this asso that's what we're gonna be doing in this classwhere they fit into our curriculum.There's a software view of the world.Turning specs into a high level languages.What that's about? You agree you're learning how to writethings from a specification into a C plus plus some programminglanguage.Hardware view is gonna be about the implementation side I talkedabout. All right.And we're gonna be doing that at#####a bunch of different levels.We can go very deep here as you might expect.Just like this can go really far up, Right.We can have some really abstract notions.I don't know, some ceo notion of what they want for um a startupcompany. Right? That's really abstract.You agree. We can go really far downsoftware going high. We go really far down in thehardware if you want to. The ease may have done that.In fact, that they've taken classes like solid stateelectronics, stuff like that. Understanding how electronsinteract with the world. Okay, stuff like that.All right. We're gonna get down to the gatelevel some very basic combinations of gates and thentry to talk about how we can use that to do computing.Okay,if you've had to say as a warning,some of you, the prerequisite for this class is uh let me dotheyeah, I'll keep going. The people that have had to 70at about week four will have a noticeable advantage.There will be 2 to 70. Review lectures and onediscussion and one um extra bonus Review session.Okay.The 270 people actually need some of that because we're gonnado it a little bit differently but by and large they're verycomfortable the topic, the whole class on it.All right. Um is it an overwhelmingadvantage, Nah?Okay. There's a week or so where theycan kind of go breathe in and you guys are like roller coasterwriting. Okay.The knuckle is kind of fun actually watching the classic.I can look around the room often identify who's who becausethere's this white knuckle kind#####of look going for some peopleand people like that. I got that.So is that fair? Is what it is? Okay.Um They have some of this lower level stuff but they don'tactually get up to the stuff that we're gonna be doing thefocus of the class. They have this lower level stuffmakes sense. Which will review or teach moreaccurate.Okay. Prereqs like I said to 80 andthen you either have to 03 or 270, which gives you basic logicat a minimum. Okay.Okay. And as a warning.The program projects R. N.C. Not C.Plus plus discussion will be doing a little bit on this.You have a homework assignment. Homework zero is already up.It's got a little bit on some of the issues.Okay. Very little.Um It's not that big of a deal.The problem is you don't have classes.All right. You don't have function members.You can use structures, classes.They don't have function members.You can fake it if you really want to if you know enough abouthow to do it with uh with function pointers and stuff likethat. Don't say no to drugs.Okay. In fact, in my opinion, and I'mvery strongly opinionated on this object orient programming,in my opinion, rarely makes sense.Below like 5000 lines of code.Okay. As a structure and disciplineonce it gets big. Absolutely.Even I a nonbeliever become a believer at that point.Okay. Because the big stuff you justneed you need some kind of structure and auditory toprovide that structure. Alright.But it may cause you some problems about getting started.The big thing is going to#####be using print F instead of C out.You'll figure it out. You can I mean, you guys are allgood at doing internet searches for stuff these days and we'llbe helping you with the two. All right.It's not like it's hard, but it is different.And so just don't be panic about it.All right.Okay. So, we did logic.Let's see if that's true. Let's consider.Andokay,so, real quick, everybody just staring at that for a moment.This is the truth table.If I'm saying S. N.C. X.Is equal to S N. C.If you have the older version of the slides, I just posted a newversion this morning.You don't have this slide. You can pull it down from thewebsite. It is there.Okay.What would I write in this boxfalse. If I say sNC it's only true whenwhen both are true. We agreeeverybody comfortable with that.We've all seen through tables before.Okay. Well you might not have seen.Is that the representation of an end?Alright. So we use that as that gate isan and gate. It just says in this case Ichanged my letters. I probably shouldn't have tothink about that. Um But in this case I've got Aand B. I've got basically Q equals A.And I'll use this notation for the moment.Be Okayeverybody coolIf you've taken to 17, not 203 a and b.All right.Clear enough. So I can do this representingthings this way.Okay. Work groups that went veryslowly.Sowe have a lot of things we can look at.So in math and philosophy there's a lot of differentlogical notations. Sothis thing is#####decided. It does not want to let meactually write on my screen.Okay, I'll try that again.So what's similar to use for an hereboy. It's not letting me race though.That's true. Okay.There we go. Slow.Good. So far everybody that's thesymbol you would have picked up in 203 or maybe some logicclass.And again here it would be Yand Zin here. It would bewhyboy,there's enough light latency on here.I don't know whyI have a new tablet. I should probably use itinstead. Huh? Haven't gotten set up yet.Okay. Actually I wanted I didn't saywhat it was so there's no output labeland then in a similar waywe have Yor Z.We have whyor Z is what will often use in this class and in most incomputer engineering land or even electrical engineering landwill use a plus and plus. Actually makes sense.Think about it. Zero plus one is what one? Okay,so we use zero for false one for true.We'll talk about that but it actually makes a reasonableamount of sense.Our symbol for or I'll just draw the gate itself if it lets me.It's interesting writing with about a half second latency.Um That's that's like to draw that better.Maybe.Yeah, drawing with the latency is really tricky.two. Is an or gate.Okay.A not gateso not here would benot. Whyhere we can use a couple different notations but mostcommon would be that.Okay And over barget not. And then the gate would looklike this.Sometimes the triangles left out.You just get the bubbleX. Or there's not really a goodsymbol over here for X.#####Or it's usually thisit's gonna be this over hereand the next year is gonna be the same as an or gate with anextra line in front of it.Get drawn badly.Okay,make reasonable sense.So this is all the stuff you've seen before.Fine.Any questions on any of this so far,What I'd like you all to do right now is introduce yourselfto your neighbor on your left and your right.So take a couple of seconds and do that.If you don't have a neighbor, your left or right, findsomebody in front of your behind you.You got 30 secondsokayhere.All right,that's enough socialization engineers.Let gowhat I'd like everybody to do. Now this is always a littletricky is I'll be doing this in class on a fairly regular basiswhen everybody get in groups of two, just you can see eachother, talk to each other and then look around and see ifthere's anybody who's not got a partner, you can become a groupof three. Makes sense.So just get a group of two and then look around, see if there'sanybody missing. You might have to get up andmove uh but hopefully not. So if you could do that realquick, you might try to get a group of two real fast.Goif you got somebody missing.Okay.All right.So what I want you to dois gonna truth table, this is not supposed to be hard.Okay, we're gonna do things in class.Sometimes that are quite hard,very commonly just to warn you in this class, what I'll bedoing is giving you a problem,which if you know#####what you're doing and we're really on top ofthings, might take three minutes to solve and I'll give you liketwo minutes. Okay.Usually just with the intent of getting people to get started totalk about it a little bit to get an idea what's going on tomake some mistakes. All right.And then to go forwardand you know, for me to talk about it, some make sense.Today. I think we can probably finishthis one. We'll see.But all I'd like you to do right now is as a group, agree on whatthis truth table should look like for S or And then theparentheses are like this C. And B.Or S. You guys understand thequestion.Okay.Go. You got about 30 seconds.Okay.Nice one.Yeah.Alrightfolks, I'm gonna stop youout of curiosity. How many of you? So, other thingis when we stop, please stop. Okay, that's hard.Also for people, um insert engineering joke here.So what I'd like to do is say there's a couple of ways wecould do this. How many of you guys as a groupgot what you think is the right answer just by kind of lookingat it for a while and figure it out.Okay, So one way you could do it is just kind of stare at it andgo, well, if s is true, then it's definitely true.We agree. So all those are true, whichlooks like theseand then if C. And B.Is true, It's also true. Which would be here.No C. And B, yep.That'd be there. And we'll also see and be true.C and B is#####true right there we agree.So that's true.That one's already true. Who cares? And everything elsemust be false.Reasonable. Another way to approach it moreformally would go through and say, okay if s is true, which islet's say here here here here and then I could do the samething with true over here. This one's going to be so false.Everyplace else. I'll just leave out thefalsehood because I'm lazy and this is true here and here.Same thing. We just did.But then I could do the or operation and go back and figureout that guy. Okay, Now you might say, wellthat was we just did that. Yeah, but when they get morecomplex, it's sometimes nice to have those intermediate stepsseem reasonable.You try to do it all in your head at some point it getsoverwhelming.So you do the intermediate steps, reasonable and goodas a note in this class, we're gonna be using true and false.We're gonna be using zeros for false and one's for troopsexactly the same thing. So this would look like zero.Is there a line there interesting?00011111make reasonable sense.Any questions about any of that.Okay, a lot of the stuff is on your homework.zero which has been assigned. I'll talk about it more in asec. But this is just kind of I thinkI just covered a lot. We'll do the list.A couple of the things that are on thereas in well, yeah, we'll talk about how much you're gonna getto it.Okay. Any questions on that? I'msorry, I went away.I do not mind at#####all. And I expect during this classto get a lot of questions. Okay.Um you'll see how I interact with people, but on the whole,I'll take all the questions if it gets overwhelming for somereason or if your question is inappropriate for the class forsome reason. Like you're asking somethingthat's just way too much or it would take about 20 minutes toanswer. It's a good question sometimeusually. Almost always.Uh but I'm like, yeah, I can't do that right now.Okay. But I'm happy to take them allright, raise your hands and let me know.Okay,so let's go ahead and get going though anybody got anything.This made sense.Okay, Zeros and ones ones and zeros true false is.And Gates or Gates, How many have you seen all that before?You've seen? Or Gates before and Gates before all that stuff.Okay. About half, which is more than Iexpected. Cool.Okay, so lectures come to lectures.Active learning will do something alright, um this and Ithink that's becomes particularly useful as thematerial gets harder.Alright, this is not meant to be hard.This is the introductory thing,discussions.I never understand why people skip discussion sections.Okay. We do record some, so you'llhave them available to you, but the ability to just kind of askand get the issues you don't have resolved resolved is good.This class we say go to whichever, like many of ourother classes go to any discussion or electric sectionthat works for you. If you go to discussion, go thatguy, woman was terrible, go to different one,you have to have at the#####same time.We're such a big class. Okay, so just find somebody whomatches your learning style. That's great.I feel like I have some really good staff but not everybody'sfor everybody, that's perfectly fine.All right,so think about itagain, all of our staff has experienced, I think they'll behelpful. Um Yeah, I only know a few ofthem, but I'm really liking what I've seen so far, so it shouldbe good.Okay. Office hours working a bitbehind on. I try to do something reallycrazy with office hours and it's not working so I'm gonna have tobag on a new plan. We'll have them up by saturday.Okay, Maybe tomorrowwe may have it figured out tonight.We'll seeum calendar from the website is up.It exists. Things like the slides you canget from there. I think this format, I'm notused to this format of a website ever taught a class with thiswebsite format, but so everybody wanted to do.I'm cool. Um, well maybe not, but I'm okayto do with this. So there's some reading.We have a textbook, it is posted on there.You can read ahead of time and find out what's going on.You'll note that homework zero is out and available to you.All right, a couple of things, comments about homework zerowhile I'm here.It is shorter, should be shorter than any other homework you'regonna have. It's meant to be about a halflength homework it may not have succeeded.Who knows? We've never done anything quite like it before.The goal is to get some basic ideas up including binary andthe stuff#####we just did with logic.All right. It should be largely review formost of you, but we definitely have 2030 40% of class thatreally struggles with that stuff earlyand we're not going to introduce some of the stuff like gatesuntil later. But just getting some basicfamiliarity. We're hoping makes things gosmoothly, especially with the 203 to 70 disparity.Okay trying something new and different.It shouldn't be very long. I don't think famous last words.We will in general. We apparently haven't done ityet. We will be posting both the pdfand a google doc that you can copy down and edit that googlecan do it that way. Okay.Somebody asked mps haven't had a chance to answer.UM Project one will be out on Tuesday.Alright. And that isnot a long programming assignment.Okay there's three parts to it. You'll see none of it'sparticularly long. It's not the english part, theprogramming part. That's hard.It's the concepts going along in that you're trying to expressthat you understand that are tricky.Okay. It also involves a fair bit ofbit manipulation which you've probably never done in C.C. Plus plus beforeand so we'll be touching on that discussion and even a little bittoday and maybe not today um will be bit stuff um HomeworkZero gets you a little bit of that, the etcetera etcetera.The other comment about homework Zero, there is definitely gonnabe stuff on that. Homework we're not teaching you.Alright but Wikipedia. It's basic stuff stuff you canpick up from a two minute Youtube video or a Wikipediaarticle or something. Okay.We#####even link to a Wikipedia article to help if you want tolook at it but it's more detailed than you need.Okay. Whatever makes you happy, youcan ask other people etcetera. That will not be true for later.Homeworks Homeworks here is a little special trying to getpeople caught up and everybody kind of leveled.Alright. Hopefully it works.If people hate it, you can tell us, but it's a new thing, we'llsee how it goes.Alright, your work questionsgoyes,otherwise noted. We will probably asking for acouple of one or two paragraph essays and those will insist onbeing typed. There may be other things weinsist on being typed, but if it doesn't say you must type this,you can do it handwritten.Okay. As long as it's neat, we reservethe right to have the great, we tell the graders if you can'tread it, don't read it okay.We're gonna give it to you in google docs, low tech for thisclass is the wrong tool. Okay.I teach 3 76 sometimes. I love love you.Tech is a little strong, I like quite a bit.I love what I can do with it even though I want to yell atabout half the time, but it's the wrong tool for this class inmy opinion. There are people who definitelytheir home works in the tech, I think they are crazy.Okay. Butthe control freaks of the world and they do exist.You know, you gotta, I gotta get that turning exactly right.Go use the tech. Um Alright, we're gonna havefour programming assignments. Some of them have#####parts, thesetwo in particular have different partsum you're gonna have a midterm in the finalEach. 24%Yeah, that looks right. Um yeah, sorry, it's probablypanicked about the midterm date being correct, but I believe itis home works on the website, correct? And I'm 99% sure that'sright. Homeworks are seven homeworks,like I said, you'll drop one of them.Okay? All the homework assignment will have a grouppart. You can do the group part byyourself if you wish. All right.But the intent is you're gonna turn again, first of all, thatwill be two things to turn in because I can't do group andindividual in the same thing on grade scope.That's how it works.So they'll show up as two different assignment and greatscope. Be aware of that.Uh And these are meant to be things that will benefit fromdiscussion. Alright.If you do the group assignments by splitting them up and sayI'll do it this week, You do it next week.That's a disaster for you when it comes to the exam and stuff.All right. So I urge you guys to actuallysit down ideally everybody tries to get started on it.You discuss for, you know, depending on this one should bepretty quick. But you know, you discussed forhalf an hour, you know, go okay, we got an answer.We're comfortable with,you know, charging one person with doing the right up isperfectly reasonable once you get to the point that it'sthere, but that's the hope and part of it is that even now postpandemic, there's just not enough connections among#####thestudents. And so it's an attempt to getpeople to get to know each other a little bit.Okay.It's also because I think it's the right way to do iteducationally, but um yeah, we've always done groupassignments in the spring career because people don't know eachother. They don't know anybody in theclass. But we found that during thesemester that's also true. So we're trying to two birds onestone. We'll see how it goes.Okay. Um First programming was postedon Tuesday. Already said that.Well that's not good.The screen, the two screens were different.That's not supposed to happen. Um Okay.Umin cyou're gonna be basically buildingon the emulatora little quick talk. When I first came here, I lookedat the first program, it's time for this class in 2000.It hasn't really changed. Not that much.Okay. No joke.Okay. UmThe guy who wrote it is brilliant and it was really goodand I loved it and I did the same thing at Msu when I taughtat Msu for a little while. Okay.But that was like the capstone project for the whole classand I came here, I'm like this is project one herb.And I looked at how well organized andset up and said, well that's just smarter than I am.I got it. Okay.This is actually quite doable but it is a lot really okay.Umso it is a lot of stuff but it is with a starting code andstuff like that. It's actually pretty doable.Okay. Unsurprisingly have an autograder,you should read through the syllabus and understand the lateday policy, understand everything else#####we made itprobably more complex than we need to.All right. Weum I shouldn't have said this actually that's a lie.It's true and it's a lie.We're claiming the project will do at eight p.m.Homework also will be accepting things to 11 59.Why is that relevant and different.First of all, we don't have a lot of sympathy for you for likeI turned it in 11 58 and it didn't work.Dude, it was due at eight. Okay, secondly.And perhaps more importantly we're gonna not really provide alot of support past eight or nine.Oclock on due dates. Okay so we expect people to tryto get things done by eight but you may have some issues sothat's what we're going for. Uh Also the four late days thehomework is even more weirdly done.UmI could go back when I have the homework page up, wow this isreally notlooking forward to a new laptop.Okay. Uminterestingbut going back to the homework thing, homeworks are also due atmidnight they got a weird policy we're trying to get becausethe classes side we have all kinds of interesting issues witheverything can break that can break right? So we basicallysay, look, you can do at midnight if you turned in by onea.m. You get 5% off, turn in afterone a.m. Till midnight the next day youget 50% off after that we don't take it.So if you have a small little problem that's causingconsternation even at the end, we just take 5% off and call itgood. Um, and we go from there if#####youdo have other problems like I don't know, I got hit by a car,you know, covid things like that.We will definitely deal with those things.Okay. The four late days are for basicissues like I got sick for a couple of days.That's what the late days are for.I got sick for a week. I got hit by a car.I've been in the hospital for a week.Yeah, yeah, of course we'll deal with that.Okay. And there's a form set up on thewebsite like you'd probably expect from other courses to getthose issues addressed. Okay.But the four late days are meant to basically take care of smallissues that come up.All right,academic integrity.The syllabus has examples of what's encouraged and whatconstitutes unacceptable collaboration.I think the 280 uses this model of, you know, by givingexamples, we have the same thing targeted toward us.You've probably seen something like this.3 76. I know we use this encouragedcollaboration, unacceptable collaboration example model toshow exactly what we're talking about.Um if you have any doubts at all, ask.All right.Okay. I'll work.You submit must be your own. All right.We had 30 honor council cases last semester.My goal is to have like 0 to 2 this semester.Okay. I just don't wanna deal withthat. You don't want to deal withthat. It's really, really bad.UmYeah. And so it's just really cancause people a great deal of academic grief etcetera,etcetera. The system is crazy.Slow. So we're resolving issues like ayear later. So you just don't want to bedealing with this. Okay, work on your own.If#####you have any doubts, ask Alright, for helpand ask what counts is acceptable or not.But basically speaking talking about things is fine.Talking about code is not easy. Peasy.Talking about abstract ideas of code.How do you shift things over? Sure.Ok, talk about how you implement this certain thing for theprogram, you know, and see on a board.No,pretty straightforward stuff. Okay,So it can be a little bit tricky to figure out where that line isif you're in doubt just either ask or just say no.All right.Questions on that.Okay, homework stuff is um And again, you can use this, you candiscuss homework problem your classmates, but you turn in yourown stuff. All right.And this were a little bit more flexible on,you know, we want you got you know, because these are oftenconceptual things. We don't want to work thehomework problem. But if there's a, you know, andthese two bit wise things and you use different bits toexplain how to do something that's fine.Okay.Just don't do the exact problem together, reasonable.In fact, we'll do this during office hours.Often people come, we're gonna be doing some group office ourthings we got a whole group of peopledon't understand any problem to Well, just working problems.Some other problem too.Okay. In many cases, that's fine,perfectly reasonable. Good.First homework is posted. Homework zero.Alright. Finally, gonna get to things Ithink are interesting. No, no, sorry, textbook Not sointeresting. Our textbook is actually verygood.Um I'm not gonna go too far into this, but the authors wrote adifferent book called Computer Architecture#####Into the ComputerOrganization.It was my first textbook. I got it when it first came outin 92,something like that. Alright.And it changed computer architecture.No joke. There are very few books in anyacademic field that are definitive changing of howeverybody thinks about things.Hennessy and Patterson's first book? Computer architecture? Aquantitative approach. Um did that.The textbook is really good. Okay.Is it really good for you? Maybe that's a different question.Um It tries a little bit too much to both be a book to learnfrom and a reference in most books can't do both.They do they do both fairly well but neither of them perfectlykind of makes sense. So it's somewhere between anencyclopedia and a learning tool.More on the learning tool side, but it tries to be a little bittoo much of an encyclopedia from time to timemakes sense.It's a good book. You should be able to, I wouldrecommend strongly to give the readings for it.Some of you are going to find the book to be exceptionallyuseful.Some of you are gonna find it to be not understandable.Alright, recommend you take a look at it though, see if it'sgood for you.All right, it's all on the website.We have the links to things, you can look at it beforehand, afterwhatever. Something confused.You can see if the book does a better jobfor you.Breakdown of the topics this lecture I.S. A.Is an assembly, we're gonna be doing about six lectures onprocess for implementation, that's gonna be that hardware,science, this is kind of the um interfaceside.This is the stuff#####below the interface side.The implementation sidewe're gonna look at memory, will do a hot topic lecture which bythe way will not be testable this semester.Um Each each faculty member will probably give a differentlecture. I'm gonna definitely watch theother two because I'm interested what they're gonna do.So I watch those on tape. It'll be fun.Um And then exam reviews and the exams themselves and stuff likethat to reviews one class counsel because we're gonna givethe exam in the evening.Good enough.Alright.So where it fits in the world,like I mentioned, uh This is the implementation side.Uh We have like quantum stuff, conductors, semiconductors,doping to add materials to silicon to make it so that ithas certain electrical properties, building things outof those dope silicon devices.Um Building more things. Much more complex, bigger thingsout of these basically individual parts.And then get into what we're going to be focusing on.All right.So we're gonna touch we're gonna do this stuff,we're gonna touch on these things some.And that's magic. Okay.We'll do a little bit of this I guess.But this is way magic. Okay for this class.Alright.So if you want to do that kind of thing, there's a lot of stuffin the E that would let you do that.Um But we're not going to we're gonna this is our focusbut my general philosophy and all of education is that you'regonna learn at a certain level of abstraction.The level below should be comfortable.Okay, you're not gonna be a master of it.That's not what the classes, but you should be#####comfortable withthe level below because it's sort of if you're not you'relike, it's like walking on ice on ice, you're not sure howthick it is. You're always gonna be nervous.Is it really okay to walk here or not? But if you knowsomething about, you know, it's been freezing for the last, youknow, 2.5 weeks and it's uh, you know,been zeroF out. Yeah, The ice is fine in mostplaces, right? You have that kind of background, thatknowledge. Same thing applies here.You kind of get a better sense what's going on? If you havethat lower level, roughly done? Understanding the same thingwith the levels above. But the levels above, especiallyfor the computer scientists in the room are stuff, you know,programming languages, et cetera.Okay.So you've usedum you're used to writing programs like this? None of thatshould look too frightening. Okay.Except for using doubles.Okay.But what's actually happening when we compile or run this? Andwhat does compiling mean?What does it mean to compile something?So 37 dot shallows. How do computers executeprograms? So we're gonna be doing,you need to know this stuff. You're gonna go do this stufffor a living. So these folks will be taking 470 almost certainly. Although sometimes people workthere with just 3 70 which always amuses me umor if you're gonna write optimized library code.Right? So you're calling something in the STL that'sreally optimized to death and back, you really have tounderstand the hardware in order to do that.Well, absolutely.If you're designing operating systems and compilers, you haveto understand the hardware. Alright.It's#####very relevant every part of operating systems compilers,but certainly percentage you have to knowworking computer security, it turns out has become extremelyrelevant.Okay, meltdown. Specter are two big bugs thatare actually very difficult to understand.You need both operating systems level knowledge and for 70 levelknowledge even understand how it's being broken.Okay. And I had both of those piecesof knowledge and I never thought these attacks are possible.All right. Somebody asked me to go, no,there's no way to do it. And then I read the papers, I'mlike, ha, that was really obvious.I feel dumb. That's definitely, definitely,definitely a problem. I'm surprised anybody canactually take advantage of it didn't even realize that wasthere to take advantage of. Okay.And I, you know, I'm by no means an operating systems guru, butstill,um, or if you work in designing embedded systems, so that's myarea more than anything and embedded systems, Internet ofthings, stuff, etcetera.Okay.But if you don't do those things, even if you just writesoftware for the rest of your life and some, you know,computer game stuff or something like that.it's important to know what your computer is doing when itexecutes code.Make a big difference in performance.So the number one stack overflow question of all time.And I confirmed it still is the number one stack overflow.I got this slide from john um Beaumont butis more or less this. Okay, so slightly different.The real question is a little bit different than this code,but it's fine. Okay.Umhe was looping through an arrayAnd the basic theme was some all#####the elements in the array thatare bigger than 128,That makes sense. The idea just have a big arrayand just for whatever reason, he wanted to sum up all the valuesgreater than 128makes sense. As an out notion.Seems like a regional piece of code.He found it took for his codes, like I said, a slightlydifferent than this code. Umhe had a really, really big array, that's fine.UmIf I took 1/2.5 seconds to some of the values.Okay, well I'll do the story a bit more detail in a second.So you go, okay, fine, whatever it took some time to sort thevalues.What shocked him,which will give away one of the answers.Okay,is thatsorting the arrayand then running the code ran at a vastly different speed.Okay,One was 1.5 seconds.One was about 10 seconds.All right.Why?How on earth could that make any senseAgain the number one question on stack overflow.Right. So mainly because it's fun butit's also a good piece of knowledge to have.So let's just do a quick everybody think about it for asecond.So I'm telling you she's not an answer.I want everybody without looking your peers in a moment to reallyand truly pick one of these answers.A B. D.C is just wrong. Okay.And these are legitimate choice.Everybody have and I have a letter in their mind at thispoint.Okay. I mean you can always what's upwith the right likeokay you don't know changing your mind once you got thislet's try again. Before I ask how many youunderstand the question? I'm claiming the code ran faster.Either sorted#####or unsorted.Okay. And I want you to answer whichone do you think was faster, basically faster on sorted sumsfaster sorted some slower or you have no idea.Okay. All in favor of asort of sounds much faster.Bde should really be everybody else.Let's try one exercise. I want to make sure of everybodywho's capable of you're raising your hand.Would you please raise your hand?Alright great. Let's try again ehB.D.Okay. A few of you still didn't managethat but Alright good enough. So the interesting thing is thatsort of goes a lot faster.Okay started to raise go a lot faster.Why you may ask. That doesn't make any sense.Right. You don't know enough to have itmake any sense at all. In fact, if you run it on areally really, really old computer wouldn't be true.Alright, it's a micro architecture implementationissue.Just like if somebody wrote some code and c or some otherlanguage right underneath your implementation, there's gonna beimplementation effects that show up because of how they wrotethat, that the the implementation of an interface,we agreein this case. What's going on interestingly,is that this if statement, if it's sorted, do agree, what'llhappen is it'll be basically saying it'll be if let's say itputs the biggest ones first, it'll basically be summing themall in for a while and it will be something none of them.You agree?We have something called The branch predictor tries to guessif this statement is gonna be executed or not.If the body of the statements can be executed or notand if it gets it#####right, things go faster.Guess what? Yes. Yes, yes, yes.Yes. Yes.Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,no, no, no, no,no, no.It's much faster than completely random.You agree. It's gonna do a better job ofguessing what's gonna happen next and a I could figure it outpretty easily.It was a really, really, really, really, really, really, really,really simple ai to do this. Okay.Called the branch predictor,All right. But it turns out the predictoreven a simple one. All yeses followed by all knows.It's pretty easy. It gets when it starts gettingno, it gets it wrong for a while, but it's like it's beenknow for a long time, I'm gonna guess.No, look, I'm right. Whereas random, you're gonna beright. Exactly.50% of the time you agree, assuming it's 50 50 chancemakes sense.So, this is why implementation matters.This is why this class can matter.Okay, Is if you're looking for performance, sometimes thesethings can bite you. You get some surprising results.You may not think, oh boy, I didn't think about sorting outfirst. Maybe that will help, you know,if you notice the difference, you're like, dude, I've gotnothing.And one thing I'd like to emphasize when I teach 376 ofthis class is that this is what distinguishes a computerscientist from a programmer.a programmer writes code. Computer scientists understandwhat's going on when code is written and then write code.Make good sense. And that can be 376 algorithms,issues and stuff like that. Or it could be implementationissues like this.Okay,All right.Sotools, uh we shape our tools and therefore our tools shape usalright. It's#####a philosopher, butinteresting character. So this is important.Understand the tools and what's going on.All right,SoI'm gonna actually not take a short break here for a couplereasons to take it in a couple of moments.Um I'm gonna point out, you can figure out what processes youhave on your phone, in your computer etcetera.They're different implementations.In fact, they have different interfaces.Arm has a different interface than X 86.Alright. Intel's processors with armprocessors are Intel makes processors, but X 86 processorswhich are mainly intel arm processors are mainly arm.Arm doesn't actually manufacture processes that go for a secondlicense things, business model stuff.They're different interfaces entirely.And therefore the implementations are of coursequite differentat the same time. There'll be differentimplementations of arm processors that are quitedifferent even though they have the same interface.Okay. That shouldn't surprise you.It's a little bit weird in the software land, somebody does anSTL. Somebody does another STL.Why would you have two different implementations?Okay.Um, but in hardware land, it makes a lot more sense.So we can get we can squeeze some performance out, we can getspecial cases to work better, etcetera, etcetera.We have a lot more trade offs, Power verse performance,etcetera. You care about battery life.Right?So you don't necessarily wanna phone.That's like awesome, awesome, awesome, fast if it dies in halfan hour.Okay. Those with really old phoneshave awesome muscle. Often slow and dive in half anhour. But you know those are that'snot usually a marketable feature.Alright.So you can take a look at that.But how programs work in a nutshell.We've got this#####stuff.The computer doesn't understand this high level code.Alright.I understand the much lower level codeand arrows are not working again.They're my screens are different.UmSo this is not something that computers can do people havetried by the way. How many of you are familiarwith? At least I've heard of a language called lISP.L. I.S. P.Okay. It's a fairly obscure mainly IIlanguage programming thing. Some of the great best schoolsin computer science using our scheme which is a list blacklanguage to teach computer science intro stuff.Okay. Should they?Alright. But in the case it's like the aipeople's language for a long time still is somewhat okay forsome of them.Somebody said you weren't gonna do, I'm gonna build a LISPmachine.I'm going to implement List because it's a relatively simpleprogramming language compared to C.Or C. Plus plus which are namelycomplex in comparison. I can build this in hardware.I'm gonnabuild something called the list machine and try to sell it.Okay.I hope that's not me. Um Next to a list machine in myundergraduate institution was a more generic machine that didsimpler things. Okay.And we converted all the list stuff into its language makessense.It ran list approximately 50 times faster than themachine. All the list machine did is runLispbut because they tried to implement the whole language inhardware, it was a disaster. Okay.We just don't do that.There is something called a semantic gap.We won't talk about it much, but there's a cement the languageyou use to communicate things english for this, but C C plusplus for programming. Yes, there#####is a language thatthe hardware understands. There's a gap between them.How big that gap, the bigger the gap, the harder it is to convertfrom one to the other obviously.But if you try to shrink that gap too much, especially movingthem if you move the top down.Okay, you're basically programming at a level thecomputer understands, but that's not, that's pretty hard forpeople.If you try to move the bottom up, it turns out we can'timplement that very efficiently.That gap probably needs to exist.Make good sense.Okay, the semantic gap I like that phrase.So in any casethis is what we're dealing with.Okay, so high level languages are intended for us, not for thehardware. So we do is we convert thiswhich is called compiling, we convert this program intosomething that the hardware does understand.All right,so zeros and ones, you know those aren't zeroes and ones,dude,Okay, we'll talk about it in a second.Listen, hacks. Okay.Base 16, but we've got memory locations.Each location These are each eight bits, two hex digits.We'll talk about it some in a secondand the computer speaks only has only zeros and ones to workwith.Always, always, always, always, always, alwaysthere is one exception. The Russians made up basicallycomputer one time. Let it go.Okay. Always, always, always, always,always. All right.Um,and sothis is called machine code. Just a bunch of zeros and oneslike I said, it's in hexi decimal right now.It's what gets produced when you try to compile something.Okay,when you create an executable,it's gonna be a machine code.Let's take a quick moment and talk#####about zeros and ones for asecond. All right.I'm gonna do this mostly just on the screen.We'll see how it goes.But the basic theme is let's do a basic review of I don't knownumbers real quick.Maybe if I can write 46. Okay,So if you look at2 462, that's more fun. Except it's not letting me writeit to. There we go.So in this caseThe two is in the what place?This is going back to 3rd grade.This is called the what?The one place we agreeThis one is called thetens place this one is called the hundreds place.Okay, written differently. That's 10 to the zeros place forthe 1, 10 to the 1st, 10 to the second.You agree?Which is why we call this base 10dustreasonable and goodfor working in binary.Okay.It's gonna be the two to the zero's place which is alsocalled the ones place agreed.Two's place which is to the first forest place, Eighthplace, 16th place. 30 seconds place.Makes sense.What number is this? Industrial?Okay. Do not yell out the answer.I want everybody those who have taken to 70.If you can't do this in your sleep, we've got issues.Alright. But I think most of you can dothis pretty quickly given a few seconds.So what is that number in decimal? Just add them up, addup all the spaces that are ones.So everybody take 20 seconds. Take a look at it.How many of you know you can compute it.Okay, so everybody take it. Like I said take another, take10 seconds. Just figure out that isif you've done this#####before. No required class teaches thisright.203 doesn't do binary.Okay,When I teach it it does, butI haven't taught it for like four or 5 years.All right,somebody give me what this isnumber45. How do we get that? We took allthe one thing which is 32 has a 18 has a 14 as a 11 has a 1.32 plus eight, conveniently is 44 plus one? Is 5 45.Okay, how many of you got that on your own?How do you understandquestions from anybodynow We often binary is really obnoxiousabout numbers. So we often group the digitsinto groups of four.Okay and we use the hex digit to represent them.What's the range of representation for a four bitbinary number? That is to say what is the smallest I canrepresent? And the biggest I can represent.What's the smallest number I can represent with four zeros andoneszero biggest15. 8 plus four plus two plus one.That makes sense.Okay so the range of representation is 0-15 which is16 different values. You agree?That should make sense.I can do 16 different values. Why? How many differentcombinations of Zeros and ones are there16? sure I can represent 16 different values.zero through 15. Good so farI can choose to represent those 16 different values.With a single hex digit.Okay what the heck digit? Just a normal digit that goes webasically go 01234.When we get to nine we then go to a B.C. D.E. F.Which would be 10. 11 12 13 14 15.Makes senseout of curiosity then what value isenough?So again don't yell it out everybody#####take a moment andthink about that.You can do it a couple of different ways.one is you could say that's the ones placeAnd that's what places that if I'm in tax base 1616 2 The first or the 16th place we agree.What is F15one time 16 plus 15 isSo 31? Base 10.How many followed that? I did it pretty quickly.Okay. Do not feel pressured in thisclass to raise your hand when you don't get it.The look that goes like thisis often because I don't understand but I don't like Idon't understand.Alrightlet's try again. How many of you understand thisquestions?So conveniently I can also convert from hex to binary veryquickly. F is 15.We agree.1234. That's 15.We agree. One is one technically speakingfollowed by four Zeros because it's you know in hex but that'dbe the binary representation for that.Okay that's why we use hex to decimal rather than base 10which is showing up here. Okayso this is a machine code. Everybody follow that.Oh I should do one quick thing. Alsolet me erase all this stuff and just ask a quick questionbecause it is on your homework And so I shouldboy. Oh boy this thing does not wantto work.Oh sonew computer coming next time.So here's a question for you.Can I write answer. Know what number is that please?In binary everybody.One's place is 12 places zero. Fourth place is one.So that's what numberfive.What number is that number? Right there? That's 45.Last I checked, we agreeif I had a zero to the end of 45, what#####number do I have?450? How much bigger to get a factor of10?What number is that in binary?That number is 10. Also that number is 10 in thiscase. You agree it was 50.Made it. How much bigger?Twice as big? Because we're in basetwo.If I had another zero here, what number you think that's gonna be20? Right. Got twice as big.Everybody follow that.And we can use operatorsthat one and that one and C. Two shift left and right.Okay. So you can do that will be onyour homework here.All right.Sothose zeros and ones are what the computer works in.That's really hard for us to write.Okay. One of the first thing computerprogrammers did is try to figure out a way not to do this.Okay. So what they did is they wrotethings that are basically correspond to the machine codebut are in ways that a human can actually work with.Okay, So we write in assembly if you look at this, you go, that'snot much better. That's that's that's ugly.Okay. But it's still better than zerosand ones or hex hex numbers. Okay.And you'll get actually pretty good at doing this in thisclass. Alright.Probably not in this language so much, but that's fine.So this is the code that might have generated for X- 86 machineSo there's usually a 1-1 correspondence with machine codeinstructions are machine code instructions gonna be usually 32bits in length. Will write some machine willwrite some assembly code that will correspond so that itconverts it into that binary for us, but in a way#####that a humancan read, we might prefer not to.All right, but it's gonna be readable in quotes.Okay.And you can do this umIf you use the minus s flag, it'll give you the assembly.All right.It will pop out the similar that's generating.So, if you just ask for it to compile, it goes to machinecode, we can ask for that. Intermediate human readable isstateAll right.So, this is relatively easy to read.That's a little bit of exaggeration, but, you knowbetter than the machine code.So, we have a couple layers we can take our C code converteddirectly to machine code.We can in theory write assembly codeand convert that to machine code.We get exactly what we want. There's really no good reasonhardly ever to write in machine code.Okay. Because assembly is justbasically pneumonic to make it easier for humans to doquestion.No, it'll put it to whatever the default output file is, which Ithink is example dot eh I think is what it'll be, But it'llcreate a file for youexample, that? S I think actually remember what gcc doesfor naming conventions,but yeah, it was just right for you.Might be out,I don't remember now.Okay. But a new file will be created.Other questions,anybody know what the file will be called,anybody that good at this stuff.I'd have to do it. I just know it appears and Ijust gowith that one done, so I don't keep it in my head.Good question. Anything else?So, basic themeis that umwe go from compiler, we really don't go to assembly language.Here we go straight#####from here to there.But you can think of it going through the assembly if you wantto, but to an excusable, which is in run on the hardware.Alright.That's what we're all about.1st 2 weeks of class are gonna cover this processand the remainder of the class will be talking about that.Okay.Maybe 2 1/2 weeks.Be aware that not one type of machine code is produced for alltypes of computers.The machine code is again,really the interface?The instruction set architecture.Okay. The list of commands and howthey workis the interface. Okay.And if I'm compiling for two different X-86 machines, I'llprobably have the same code at least it will run the same code.They might choose to optimize they know something about theunderlying interface, but usually it's gonna be the samecode. Okay.But not all computers are the same have the same interface.Okay. Just like there's severalprogramming languages. There are also severalarchitectureinstruction set architectures that exist.Okay.Popular I. S.A S X 86 arm, RISC five um are all things risk five is popularas uhthe wrong word, but it's getting there.Okay. Um, code compiled from onearchitecture will not run on another.Okay. It's having differentinterfaces. If I'm doing a graphics library,I have two different graphics libraries.If I write code to work with one, it ain't gonna work on theother. We agreesame exact notion. I have three differentimplementations of the same graphics library.Well, guess what if the implementations are of the sameinterface? Code written will run on all 31 may run moreefficiently on one than the other.one may be better at ray#####tracing than the other or somethingelse. Right.You might choose to use a different implementation becauseit runs your code better. Makes sense.Same thing absolutely applies here.Absolutely.Each different processor. Micro architectureimplementation,we'll have different tradeoffs that trade off might be it's oldand cheap. Okay.The trade off might be that is going for low power.The trade off might be going for low cost.All right.And so they're gonna have different levels of efficiencyand things like that. That might be It was designed bya bunch of really bad people,turns out those don't sell very well, but they do sell just likecars, right? There's some bad cars on the road.People still buy them.All right,but they're, they're out there,but code compiled for one interface will not run on theother one. Architecture will not run theotherboy. This thing is having fun.X- 86is an old onedesigned by Intel. There's the next 64 bit version,There's a couple different versions out there.Uh, it tends to be beefy complex for sure.Fast. Power hungry used in desktops,mini laptops, servers, some games consoles.Okay.It's old old old old old old old old.I actually have a copy of one of the first intel chips made.The 404, I think it's the first one made.Um, and I just got that because I was at Intel for this 25thanniversary, I was working there.So my wife and I both have a little chip in a clock.Okay. She worked there too.Um, and we go from there.Arm designed by arm, it's versatile.It's used in a lot of smart phones.Uh, some Macbooks, some weird#####supercomputing clusters intendto switch a lot of different things.Use the arm architecture as the interface.Okay.Risk five. Very popular academia.I don't know that's what's that line.It's like being the principal of a home school.Um, you know, it's very popular in academia where we don'tmatter. Um starting to make its way intoactual products. Some of my students uhdo a lot of work in this area,a lot of companies trying to get this to workwhy? Because it's free.So the way intel makes its money is selling chips,the way our makes its money weirdly isn't selling chips,it's selling licenses to their design stuff.The way Risk five makes money is oh it doesn't because it's anonprofit e thing. Okay, so it saves people thelicensing fees from army etcetera etcetera.Alright. Is it a real thing?It's getting there. It's like I said, some of mystudents, one of my former students are definitely makingmoney in the area. Whether the companies areworking for will make money a little less clear.We're gonna primarily focus on a subset of the arm called leg.Okay. Yes, that's supposed to be a badjoke. Uh There's also by the way, thereal arm version has a subset called thumb.So yeah, but we use something, we call leg made up.I say we were also gonna be using a made up.I say we call the L. C.Two K.It is a very simple thing. All right arm.M is trying to get the idea across here.L. C.Two K. Ad.Okay. X 86 does real things.So the X 86 depending on how#####you count.It has many hundreds to many thousands of assemblyinstructions.The L. C.Two K. Has 81 of which is the donothing instructions. So seven.Okay. Different, different, different,different this is a toy.Okay. Toy real thingmaking sense.But the toy is extremely useful for us to learn from, which iswhy we do it.All right. A lot of schools use this L.C. Model of teaching thatoriginated here. UmAnd we're just one of the schools that do, although we usea different version of L. C.Than everybody else because ours is even simpler than theirs.UmSo this kind of makes sense.So we're gonna be using, like I said two things.We're gonna be using a subset of arm called leg because armitself is way too complex to do. Alright.It's something you can learn but it's not a good teaching tool.L C two K. We're gonna use as our primaryteaching tool whenever we can. But sometimes it's just toosimple. And so we have to go talk aboutarm stuff. We're gonna be expecting youguys to leg. We're gonna be expecting tolearn this subset of arm stuff. We're gonna be doing the L C twoK. All of your coding assignmentswill be in L. C.Two K.And in some cases even a subset of LC 2K.Because even then some of the things are a little hard toimplement. Okay.Project threethrows out one instruction because it's just annoying todeal with.And the the cost benefit analysis is yeah, it takes a lotmore time and you don't learn anything extra.So why?But that's what we've got good so far.And#####arm is a real assembly language leg is not really, butit's it's just a subset of a real one.It's like learning spanish and only learning 500 words or 1000words. Okay.Does that mean you haven't learned spanish? So you learnsome spanish, you can talk to people just they can say thingsyou don't understand,You can go look up the word and you can you're in better shapethan you are if you didn't learn those 500 words make sense.1000 words.Okay,a couple of things you should be aware of,so that's kind of the context, what we're gonna do.I want to put some context around computing in general atthe moment. Okay,computers,this is a log scale, you'll noticeguys, I'll see that very much a log scale.This is time.This is the number of transistors.Number of basically components. Alright.Probably the best software analogy.The number of characters in my code.Okay.You know, just some basic fundamental component.Maybe a number of key words or something.It doesn't matter.It's been growing exponentiallyMoore's law said basically speaking the number oftransition is gonna double every 18 months, something like that.Okay,managing to mostly keep up, we're falling a little bit offthe curve these days. Okay.Computers have a lot more capability every year.Is that clear?It's dying off a little bit for a few reasons.We're gonna talk about the big reason in just a moment, butwe can add a lot. We have a lot more transistors.Good sense. So farthis is a little bit complex. I've been debating out how totalk about it. So I'm gonna try to talk#####aboutthe slides for a minute.Each transistor is a switch on off switch, basically.Okay,good. So fareach switch takes a little tiny bit of power.So electrical power, you put in your plug in, your computertakes power makes sense.What happens to power in general? Anybody know when youuse it to do something,generates heat in general has the energy has to go someplacethe power has to go someplacemakes sense.So, one of the problems we're having is thatif I have a lot of transistors, each one of them was a littlebit of energy. Now, obviously things will getreally hot. That makes sense because if eachone takes a little bit of heat generated, gets a little bit ofenergy, that energy becomes heat, we're just gonna get alittle bit warm.Okay, solet's buy that for a moment.This notion of the nards scaling, which I have up here onthe slide, is that? Yeah, that's true.But it turns out as a transistor gets smaller,each one uses less energy, which kind of seems reasonable.Right,Okay.And so the idea is in a given area,our chips are gonna be two dimensional, basically, theyactually have a third dimension, but there it's really thin, sodon't worry about it. Okay,in two dimensionsfor a given size of chip,the heat will stay constant.Because of the transistor gets smaller, it uses less power,generates less heat, seem reasonable.That's not being true. Somewhere around 2000-2007,depending on who you ask. Alright.Denard scaling stops being true.We can still put back in, we can pack in many more transistorsper unit area. We can make somewhat#####biggerchips that are gonna be warmer, but at least the warmer isdistributed. Right?But now the chips, while the smaller transistors are coolerthan the bigger ones, they're not cooling.So that the area, the heat in a given area is constant.It's going up quite a bitkind of makes sense.So what's the problem? When you get too hot?When chips get hot, one problem is they will slow down, whichsounds weird, but it's true. It has to do with electrons andholes migrating through metal and um silicon Sure, whatever.Okay, but just basically speaking, when things get hot,it's like things are vibrating really quick.That seem reasonable. That's what he does is vibrationof small elements and we're trying to get electron to movethrough something and everybody's jumping around.It's really hard to get any kind of momentum going and gettingbumped into seem reasonable.So things are a little slower for electronic to move throughthe system. Okay.The other problem is what I like to call in the really technicalterm, the melty melty problem.Okay, if you get too hot, it just belts.Okay, so we have this heat is a problem for us.Very much a problem for us.So, the scaling transistors get smaller.The power density stays the same when it's true translation isthe number of transistors on a chip grows the power staysroughly constant.Somewhere in the mid 2000s. The general scaling broke.Why? Because basically speaking, they got so small that there wasthe electricity could just kind of flow out places.It wasn't supposed to called leakage and the leakage currentbecame dominant.All rightconclusion.#####If you try to power all thetransitions on the chip, it doesn't work.You'll melt the processor.This is one of my favorite slides of all time from anactual academic paper. Somebody I wasn't an academicpapers from, but in that context, they decided to see ifthey could fry an egg. And the answer was they couldnot. The reason wasn't because itwasn't hot enough. The reason was that just burnedit,it was too hot. If you ever cooked eggs on toohot of a temperature, you know it just turns black and the eggdoesn't cook. Yeah, that's what happened.Okay, these things are hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot hot.Modern ships are well above the power density of a nuclear powerplant.Okay. Getting the heat out is a bigdeal. If you talk about something, youknow I have a really cool gaming setup, it's liquid cooled.Why does it matter if it's liquid cooled? They can get theheat out, they can run the chip faster.Okay,so just like a radiator in a car.Now if you use something like liquid nitrogen you can get itreally cold.Alright, and that's always been true because this has alwaysbeen an issue but it was always the same issue and now it's justgotten so much worse. Okay, so we can't run all theprocessors at the same time, all the transistors at the sametime.Okay.Um I wanted to talk about a couple other things but whathappened to my slide, I lost a slide, interesting.So let me do the next part of this, which I'm really annoyed Ilost#####somehow. Umthe way we have addressed this problem over time is twofold.Actually my slide only talked about one of them.I'll update the slides are missing a slide I wanted, it'snot like you need it for the material, it's just somethingI'd like to have as a thing to talk at,what we've done is a couple different things.One trick weirdly, is to have multi core.Okay,why does that even make sense? It's actually pretty hard toexplain. In fact, one of the 4 70program, one of the 4 70homework assignments is to write a paragraph or two.Trying to explain it to somebody who understands basic computing.Why? Multi cores makes sense? But the basic theme is if I wantone core to run twice as fast, it takes about eight times asmuch power mumble mumble wave wave because it does.Okay,so an obvious thing to do if I have eight units of power, Icould either run one core at double the speed, eight times ofpower or I could run eight cores at one speed, you agree.And if I can make all eight cores of those actually useful,that's clearly much better. Four times as much performance.We agreethere's this nonlinear relationship between power andperformance.One way we can deal with that is to just have lots of cores,you'll find things with 60,000 cores and stuff like that youcan get for GPU s and things like this.Okay,if you have a highly parallel problem and you have aprogramming language and a programmer is capable of usingthem.You can rock it out. Makes sense#####in the heat issueisn't as big of a deal for you because again, each of thesecores can run relatively cool,good, so far.The other thing that matters for us is what we're gonna callspecialized compute. Alright.What this means is so back in the day,10 years ago.All right.If somebody said I'm gonna make a specialized computer that doesthis one task really well, the answer is that thing is gonnatake you a couple extra years to design.By the time it's done, a generic computer will be able to do yourspecialized compute just as well as you.This is stupid. Don't do it.And so there are only very few specialized computer engines inthe world. Kind of makes sense.But now that we've kind of hit a tail where we can't really do awhole lot more performance on a single core.A reasonable thing to do is to optimize that court to docertain tasks exceptionally well.There were last, I checked about 30 startups trying to do a Imachine learning chips exceptionally well because thoseproblems have really consistent structures.Okay.And so about 30 companies started probably five or six ofthem will be successful. Alright.And seriously,my 470 students are working at these startups.Okay, that's what they're doing, because it's like the where thecool kids go, I guess. Alright.Um, and some of them have been pretty successful.I have a couple 100 employees, they're probably gonna make itAll right.Same thing for network, thanks for the internet of things thingthing. Same thing for, same thing forthe same thing forreally specialized compute is becoming a#####new thing.A lot of us view this as the golden age of computerarchitecture, because before our job was to build a genericcompute engine that anybody could use and just kind of letit ride on the rollercoaster of moore's law,we can't do that anymore.So for a while, at least we're gonna have to figure out howelse to do things. And specialized computers.Opening up a ton of jobs in this field.Okay. Mostly for machine learning, butnot just machine learningkind of makes sense.And so we're in an interesting point place, an inflection pointin computer architecture,this inflection point is gonna run for probably another 10years at least. Okay.Um, and so it's really a very interesting time.We're gonna be looking at generic compute, but by the timewe get done, the idea of specialized compute willhopefully make sense to you. I want to do this one task, Iwanna do it really efficiently. Well, sure, I can make hardwarethat does that one task efficiently.It's gonna do everything else. Not so well, but if I'm doingthat one thing, 99% of the time, it's awesome.Makes sense.Okay,so what happened to my slide?It's gonna magically appear now, nope.Still not there. Okay.Project one posted on Tuesday, homework.Zero is posted due Wednesday. Please get going on.It discussion starts this week. Um a couple other quickcomments. Next week's not this weekdiscussion, but next week's discussionis our discussions on monday on friday and monday.That's gonna be MLK. We're doing something weird withour friday and basically making sure you all have theopportunity to get a debugging#####set up working on your laptop orwhatever your computing environment is.Okay. One of the big problems we haveis people come to us and I can't get this to work.Well, what does itsay? I don't know how to use it to bugger.Okay, so we sit down with people and figure that out.So that is not this. So, this discussion absolutelygo to,is there a lot of things like how to use the C programminglanguage, stuff like that you're gonna want?The next discussion is a little bit weird.And after that will be more traditional discussions.See y'all, good luck again if you have questions, come bug me.UmsoYou know the answer to this question, butno, no, no, I'm gonna walk you through.So let's do it in base 10. So 465.Yes. Right, Sothat'swhatthat isright

Hello.It's thursday almost break almost.We have a homework due tonight at 11 59.Make sure you get it in. Uh We have some office hourstoday in person and remote. We have one hour of remotehours. Um Stop by.We're here to help. UmThis assignmentcovers a lot you know a lot of what we've been doing in thepast few weeks. So it's a good indication ofwhat you might want to focus on reviewing versus stuff thatyou've completely understoodAnd you can focus on something else.Um your drafts were due last night if you did not get it inand there is a good chunk of you who did not turn them in lastnight. You do have until today at noon.Well 1230 to get those um drafts in through canvas with aone point deduction after that you will not be getting creditfor the draft.Um If you don't turn in your draft through canvas it will notbe part of the peer review process.You will not get any feedback from your peers.The peer reviews are going to open at 12 45andyou can get those done before you take off for your break.Okay technically they're due next week on Tuesday but I wouldencourage you all to get them done before you start yourbreak. That way you can completely takea pause from stats to 50 for a week because there really isnothing to do next week. If you complete the peer reviewsbefore you take off for a break. Okay get those done,invest an hour, get them done and then that's#####it you're done.Don't procrastinate. Be good to your future selves.Okay? And I also encourage you that while you're here, you'realso good to your future selves. You're investing an hour and ahalf. Work through the ideas thatwe're working through in lecture.Hence you don't have to reinvest this time later on after thebreak because you're doing it now.Okay. Otherwise it's double timeand that's one thing that we often lack time.Okay so make sure that you're here invested.Work through the problems with me, understand ask questionsabout regression focused. I know it's hard in these daysto stay focused, butt focused, get something out of it.You're here for an hour and a half.Don't invest this time yet again afterthe lecture. Okay, highly highly recommendthatumnext week we have no labs, no lectures, no office hours otherthan m right fellows have a few office hours on Tuesday toanswer any peer review questions you might have.But other than that nothing. No new homework opens tonight.We truly want you to take a break,decompressed for a week before you come back and wrap up thesemester and do a strong finish. Okay,Shall we go through regression.So a few things we need to wrap up, we won't get through it alltoday. But that's okay.So regression is looking at the relationship between twoquantitative variables. we have to have two quantitativevariablesand their order for us to get a visual, which is always thefirst step in data analysis, understand your data, visualizethe data, explore the data in order for us to get a visual ofthis#####relationship between these two variables.We're going to use a scatter plot.And as you've noticed by now we are almost at the end of thesemester. Every time we have a graphicaldisplay, we have to include some sort of commentary about what wesee in the graphical display. You did that with? Em right.You have your side by side box plot in your draft.You needed to provide something for the readers.What is it that they should focus on in that plot.You did the same thing with the hissed a gram of thedifferences. Right.What was so meaningful about that, hissed a gram.What are positive differences? What are negative differences?Why are you looking at differences Because of thedependent scenario?So the same thing goes with the scatter plot.When we have our scatter plot, we're going to be conveying theidea of a form? What type of relationship in terms of itsform do we see between these two variables? What is thedirection? What is the strength? And are there any outliers thatyou think? Might there be any outliers? So always use thatvague language because we don't give you the tools to decidewhether something is an outlier or not.We want to hear your perspective of that.Okay,now, when it comes to the strength for your description itis subjective, What is it that you consider strong versus weakversus moderately strong or moderately weak.But then there's also a summary that quantifies that strengthand that's your correlation coefficient.The magnitude of that correlation coefficientis the strength of the association.The closer that magnitude is to#####one,the stronger the association, the closer than magnitude is tozero the weaker the association. That correlation coefficientalso provides a positive in the negative direction of theassociationand then everything we do as you'll see today will have thisvery long formulasthat students will gravitate and want to use however our providesall these key components if you know where to look.So regression is one of those um topics that really relies onnavigating and knowing your way around our output becauseeverything is there, as long as you know where to look as you'llsee today. Okay, so from this regressionoutput we can pick up the linear relationship, themodel, the equation of the line, here's my y interceptand that also provides the slope for mefrom the output.You can get this equation of the line, we went through how tocalculate that equation of the line with formulas but you canjust pick it up from here. Okay,sounds good,what else are we going to do?We're going to dive deep into this correlation coefficient.Rbecause it provides this very nice idea for us.So with regression there's a lot of things you can do.The first four things is what we called descriptive regression.And we'll wrap that up today. The last three things is theinference part of regression, and we'll work through one ofthose. One of the three ideas.There? Only one. Okay, are we readyour square? Let's think about this measure.So we want to pay attention for like two minutes so that weunderstand this r. Square valuebecause this is such a key value,#####Such a key component andwe love it so much because it has a very nice intuitiveinterpretation. Okay,so fact is monthly rent prices are different,right? Even if you were to look at the same apartment size,you will get variability in monthly rent prices.Not every single apartment has the same price.We want to understand the variability of our response,which is monthly rent prices.If I only had eight listings and Ionly had information about eight monthly rent prices.These prices are going to vary. I'm not gonna get the same rentprice, gonna be variability there.If I wanted to predictthe monthly rent price for someone who's interested inrenting an apartment, what would be my best guess based on thefact that I only have access to eight listings in their monthlyrent price.What would you suggest as the best guessif you have quantitative data,only eight observations and you want to make a prediction usingthese eight observations that only include monthly rentprices, what would you predict?What would be a good educated guess?No waythe average, right. If all I had was access to eightobservations and I want to make a prediction using these eightquantitative observations, my best guess is going to be theaverageand I would make the same prediction for everyone.Just the average.The whole point of regression, though, is to understand whatcontributes to this variability in your response.And if I only have access to my response, I'm going to be makingthe same prediction all the time,but we know that prices of apartments, rent, prices varyand that variability is due#####to many factors, some of it isapartment size. What are other factors thatcontribute to the variability in monthly rent prices? What do youthink?I'm sure you all look for apartments? Right.As college students, that's part of being a student, you have tofind a place to live. Right.So what factors contribute to the variability wesee in monthly rent prices? What have you noticed?Location? Right. Location is definitely a factorthat contributes to that, what elsesize,number of bedrooms,what elseamenities? Right.The age of the building?Right. Very old buildings versus newbuildings,parking? Does they have parking or not, that contributes to thevariability and monthly rent prices.So there's all these factors that contribute to thevariability of monthly rent prices.And my job is to understand that variability of monthly rentprices. But the way I'm going tounderstand it is by selecting one of the many factors becauseof simple regression. So I only have one variable thatI can use. Right?So when we look at this variability of our monthly rentprice is really composed of two things is composed by thevariability that is explained by the variable you'veselectedand the variability that's left unexplained because it's due toother factors. So in our case the variabilityof monthly rent priceis some portion of that is explained by the apartment sizeand some other portion is left unexplained because it's due tolocation amenities, age of the building.Does it have parking or not? So this r square quantity is suchan important measure for us because it has a very niceintuitive idea.It is a quantity between zero and 1#####which implies it is aproportionand it is a proportion of the variability in the response thatis actually explained by the one variable you selected.So if this proportion is closer to one,what does that tell you about the explanatory variable youselected?Is it explaining a lot of that variability.Yeah, there's a very few variability left.Unaccounted for by that explanatory variable.If that correlation coefficient, if that r square value is closerto zero,then that explanatory variable you selected to understand thevariability of that response is not that great,right? It's not accounting for a lot of that variability.It's not explaining a lot of that variability.So let's look at this value where we find it in our outputand how do we interpret it?So where are we gonna find this? R square quantity?It's part of the coefficients outputand right under it are some numerical summaries,some of which are your art score quantities, one is the adjustedR square. We never use this one.The adjusted is used when you have a model that has more thanone explanatory variable because you can think of creating amodel that includes all your explanatory variables.Right? If you had access to that and it would be a very goodmodel. But then you have to adjust theart square because in your square quantity would be oneand that can be. So you need to adjust it.So that's what the adjusted R square is for.So we don't use it because we're using simple regression.So our our square isthe multiple are square. There it is.So what does this#####number tell you? In our example, itsuggests that 67.24of the variation. In my response is actuallyexplained by the relationship it has with the explanatoryvariable.In other words, 67.24% of thevariation in monthly rent price, which iswhat we are trying to understandis explained by the relationship it has withapartment size,67%of the variation we see in these monthly rent prices is actuallydue to the fact that you're looking at different apartmentsizesAbout 67%.The other 32% is left unexplained that other32% is due to location amenities, theage of the building, whether it has a park parking or not, theother 32% is not accounted for with this model.Does that make sense in terms of our art square, such a beautifulnumber and we love it so much because of this intuitive ideathat alludes to how good of a model you have.Is it a good model? Did you pick the right explanatory variable?Well, let's look at this Art square quantity and see whetherwe did select an appropriate explanatory variable of the manywe could have chosengood.Now, if we have the R square quantity, can we compute thecorrelation coefficient? Rwhat do you think?Probably right. Because we're not always gonnahave access to data, especially at an exam setting.Hence we can't just use the core function to compute thiscorrelation coefficient. So we have to use output in onepossibility is to use the r square quantity to compute ourcorrelation coefficient. It is going to be the squareroot of our square.I do want to add to this the plus or minus to remindourselves to#####always checkis it a positive direction or is it a negative direction? Andwe're gonna check using either the sign of the slopeor the direction of the scatter plot or inin our case, what type of direction do we haveslope is positive. We looked at the scatter plotand we said it was a positive direction.So we do have a positive directionpositive correlation coefficient because that positive negativegives you the direction and then square root of r R squarequantity.Always multiple are square. Never adjusted .6724.So we getOur Correlation Coefficient .82.So from the r square quantity we can get the correlationcoefficient,which is what you would do on a homework or an exam where wewant to provide some output. That provides lots of pieces ofinformation rather than the direct output of the correlationfunction. Okay, yes,that's still white.So our square measures. So when do we use our squareversus our both are alluding to the strength of the associationbetween x and y. Are square provides themagnitude provides the strength and it also provides thedirection.That's what the correlation coefficient gives us from forour model,Our square howevergives you that I concept but without the positive and thenegative. But it has a very niceinterpretation because your art square quantity is from 0 to 1and it's a proportion. The closer that proportion is tooneimplies that your explanatory variable is doing a very goodjob at explaining all the variability you see in yourresponse.Which is by definition what we are trying to do withregression.Why are we using regression tolook at the relationship#####between your X and your Y.Hmmdirection,squarestrength.So the R. R correlation are always givesyou a direction which is not what you get from our square.What you get from our square. Is this nice interpretation thatalludes to the original goal of regression which is tounderstand the variability of your response by including amodel that has many explanatory variables.Good.Last things about descriptive regression.Before we move on toinference,nonlinear relationshipsalways visualize your data are will always create a linearmodel for you. Even if the relationship is notlinear. So as step one, you always needto visualize explore your data. You did that with em.Right, you're gonna continue to do that provide the rightgraphical displays to understand your data before you conductyour analysis.Outliers, outliers could influence your regressionline.It could be quite influential. So we don't give you the toolsto understand outliers. Um We simply want you to commenton whether you have outliers or not, potential outliers in yourdata set or not?But they could steer your analysis in one direction oranotherand then the other one is dangers of extrapolating.When we do regression analysis,you can only make predictions within the range of X.If you make predictions outside the range of X, then you don'treally know what the china is going to continue to be.That's different analysis, but not with regression.With regression. It really is only for the rangeof X. Otherwise you're extrapolatingand then you have to do further analysis.Okay, so here's an exampleof extrapolation. What's gonna happen in the21 56 Olympics for sprintersshould be sprint, nice spring.What's gonna happen?We#####have winning timesFor sprinters and then eight and then year not eight year.And they have records for the Olympics.Up to this was up to 1996. They gave you an r squaredquantity for males in our square quantity for females.And what did they decide to do extend the line? So that in theyear 21,which is what they're predicting something great is gonna happen.Finally, women and men are gonna run just as fast.There's not going to be a difference,but why do we stop there? What would be even a better headline?What is it?Huh?With women actually run faster than men? Furthermore, whenwe can do winning time inzero seconds. Right?Furthermore winning a race innegative time. Right? Why stop at the year 2156. Right.So this isan example of extrapolation. You don't extrapolate.You don't know what's gonna happen.You don't have information for that.Okay. There's no need why you need tostop at 21 56. You can even make a betterheadline if you actually continue further into the futurebased on their analysis. Okay.The other one is dangerous of combining groupsinappropriately.So, a school district wanted to understand what the optimalduration of study is for students to achieve satisfactoryresults.So they asked teachers various classes to do a survey amongtheir students and they plotted the results of the survey thatlooked at the preparation hours and then their final percentage.What do you noticenegative direction?Right? Strong relationship.It looks. Okay.Right.What would be a message based on this plotstudy? Lessperform better?Does that make sense?Should I be advertising that to my students study less? You'llperform better.Yes.Quality#####versus quantity. That's what I should be.Advertising quality of study versus quantity of study.So what's going on,what do we thinkthey did ask teachers? Various subjects.So, of course, some subjects require more versus less.Right. So, if you actually look at eachsubject,you see why you see this type of relationship.It doesn't make sense because the data was combinedinappropriately. There's confounding factors herethat don't really highlight what's going on.You should be analyzing this data separately by subject.Okay, so that's what we mean by Simpson's paradox.And then the last thing is even if the correlation is exactlyonewhich is unheard of. But even if you cannot say thatX is causing Y to occurthe different analysis and conversation is very hard toprovide a convincing argument for.Okay.Okay.And that isit for descriptive analysis.Shall we practice it? Going back to our long eyelashes? We havethree questions you get to work through and click in.Think about what we've seen so far.Check. Did I understand these lastitems. Do I know where to look in ouroutput to come up with these ideas? One less thing to worryabout after the break in terms of studying for that exam.If not ask raise your hand,ask away.Try it out.You're here. And that's that time check.Do I know how to answer these questions If it were to appearon homework eight that I consume through the hallmarkor one less thing to study for that exam which is intwo weeks if you don't count. Thanksgivingthere's a clicker for the correlation.Be good to your future selves. There's not much time#####left inthe semesterare you justso what's the correlation between these two quantitativevariables.How are we gonna find this correlation?Have your correlation coefficient? Go ahead and clickin decide which one matches your core correlation coefficientbased on the clickers.So we want the correlation between these two quantitativevariables, which implies we want the correlation coefficient.RIf we don't have the data set in front of us, we can't use thatcore function to compute this correlation coefficient like wewould in lab after the break.So where are we going to get that correlation coefficient? Rlucky for us this our output provides the R square and we'renever going to use the adjusted R squarebecause that implies that we have more than one explanatoryvariable. If we had more than oneexplanatory variable we would be using that adjusted R square butthat's not our case. We have simple regression.One explanatory variable. We go with the multiple aresquareplus or minus square root of our square.Is it going to be positive or negative?The slope will determine the sign based on the slope we havea positive direction. So it's gonna be a positiveassociation. You can look at the slope.You can also look at the scatter plot.6069giving meA correlation coefficient of.779.and only about 60% of us got that.The other common answer was aand a is your R square quantity, which is not the correlationcoefficient.Should I add units to this quantity?No, the correlation coefficient is a unit less quantity.No units.If I were to change all of my data and convert it tomilligrams, I will still get#####the same correlation coefficient of.779. No units.Okay.Ready to try the next one.What is this asking for?This is an interpretation ofare squareSo we can pick up our square from the output.There it is 60.69% of the variationin the response is explained by the relationship thisresponse has with the explanatory variable.My response is whateyelash with lengthand my explanatory variable isthe eye withSo 60.69% of the variations I have inthese responses in these eyelash lengths that I have in my datais actually explained by the fact that we're looking atdifferent umeyes of different sizes.The rest is left unexplained by this factor.Some other thing is explaining the restgood.And finally the last oneclicker.What do we think about this one? Giraffes?The eye with of giraffes um of a giraffe was measured and foundto be 4.08 cm.Should we use this model to predict the eyelash length forgiraffes?Yes or no. Would it be valid? We can alwaysdo it right but is it valid?It's a formula. So we can always plug stuff intothe formula and outcome some sort of predicted value but isthat predicted value meaningful or valid for the analysis?Go ahead and discusswith your neighbors please.And that's the time that you're in herebe good to your future selves. You're here for an hour,understand regression. One less thing that you have toworry about for that exam that's coming up soon.The hardest part was getting here.Now that you're herestay focused for an hour.You already did the hard part which issnowing and you're here.Now let's gain something out of it.Okayso can#####we do thiswhen we make predictions? We should always be makingpredictions withinthe range of our explanatory variable.So if you look at the scatter plot, is this outside the rangeor inside the range of my explanatory variable?It is outside the range. So hence we cannot use thismodel to make predictions for giraffes.So we're not gonna use it because it is outside the rangeof my explanatory variable which is i with this isextrapolating an example of extrapolatinggood.We are done with the descriptive side of regression.Now comesthe inference.The new stuff for a lot of us.So let's pretend for a second that instead of just having asample of observations, I actually had apopulation of observations. The entire population data set.What would my scattered plot look like?I wouldn't just have eight xy combinations.I would have for every single listing in the city.I would have all of those xy combinations.So my scatter plot would have lots and lots and lots and lotsof lots of dots.If I actually had population data, I could fit a linearmodel through that population dataand that linear model would bethe true regression line.The true population regression linewhich only exists ifI had population data, which I don't I always work with sampledatabut that line does exist.What have we done so far with inference? We take our sampleand a statistic and we always want to learn about thepopulation parameter.The same thing applies to regression is just a little bittrickier. But the same idea appliesif we actually had population data we would have aregression model#####for this population data.So this one requires population data.What we have access to thoseis sample data.So my best guess as to what that population model might be is theone I create using my sample. So this one only requiressample data.So it's analogous to having a sample and finding a statisticthat's estimating the population parameter.That is unknown.So this true line is that population idea that does existif you had population data and your best guess is based onsample data, which is that sample version of a regressionline.Now that population data, the population regression line ismade up of Parameters. So beta zero is your true.Why interceptfor the population of interest.We don't have population data. So we always use our statistic,B0 is your statistic which will vary from sample to sample.Because if I had different observations, I'll create adifferent regression line. So this is my sample, yinterceptand it variesfrom sample to samplejust like every statistic.The same thing happens with slope.Beta one is my parameter and that's my populationslope. Which requires population datain order to know its quantity. And the best guess for thatpopulation slope is my sample slope.My statistic.So we still have this idea of parameter versus statistic isjust a little bit different from what we are used tobecausewe have an equation of the line that we're estimating basically.Okay, using the sample.Now when we do inference, where are we gonna go with this?We are going to assess if we have a linear relationshipbetween the X and the Y. The explanatory variable in theresponse.#####If we're assessingLinking it back to homework seven.The last question, if we are assessing a claim,what type of inference method should we usea test of an interval?When you read those options on question nine of homework seven,if you're assessing a claim, what method are you going to beusing a test or an interval?A test? Right. So when we assess if we have alinear relationship, we're going to conducta hypothesis test.We're also going to be providing intervals around our estimates.After all this data. This regression line, Thissample regression line is based on a sample data and if I had adifferent sample, I would have a different sample line.So instead of just providing a predicted quantity, like we'vebeen doing, we're gonna construct intervals around ourpredictions and talk about the different types of intervals wecan have.And then the last thing is assumptions.That's always the last thing you do in regression because youneed the model.So let's start with the first one.Shall wetake a break before we start?Yes,two minute break, stretch. Come back.Focus for the last part. So you have one less thing toreview after thanksgiving.You don't wannaaccumulate things.Okay, shall we start?Yes,So we're gonna conduct a testwhich means we have to have some sort ofMeasure of variability. Okay, so going back toway back, Chapter two, a standard deviation.That standard deviation measured the average distance of anobservation to the mean, a typical observation to the meat.That's what that standard deviation provided for us.It turns out that regression also has its own standarddeviation,but it's not the same#####as what we had before.So that standard deviation is looking at the average size ofthe residual on average. How far away are your observedvalues from the predicted? If you notice all of these lines,horizontal lines are your residualsfrom Tuesday residuals areyour errors.Some of these residualsare quite large, we were way off for some um predictions.Some of them are very small. We were almost there some mighteven be zero right on target. Right? So we want to get a senseof the average size of these residuals, Some are big, someare small. What is the average sizeroughly? How far off is your estimate from that observedquantity?So that's what we're gonna call the standard deviation for theregression. So it is an average size whichmeans it's going to be adding thingsanddividing by a total right? That's how you find average toadd things up and divide by a totalby definition. That's how you do an average,it is the average size of the residual the error term.How do we find each error term? We look at the observation.How far away is that observation fromthe predicted value?Here's your observation and here's your predictedand you're measuring the distance between those two.The residual observed minus predicted.And you're doing that for every observation because you want toget that average size of these residuals.So here's the second one.Why? To how far away it is from its predicted quantity.Let's just go to the last one.The last observation, how far away it is fromit's predicted quantity.Now, if we leave it as is some#####of these errors are positive,some are negative because sometimes we overestimatesometimes we underestimate. So if we were to just computethese errors and add them up, we would getzero things canceled out. What's her quick fix?Square?We've always done that.So let's square everything.And if we're squaringwe need to unscrew air so we need to take the square root ofitand nowthe sample sizeIt is true that to find an average you have to divide by atotal. However our total is not goingto be in, it is going to be N -2.We're losing 2° of freedom.The reason for that is every time we include an estimate intoour measurements we need to compensate for introducing errorby taking away a degree of freedom.Where are we introducing estimates.When we find white hatWe're using B0 which is a statistic.And we're using B1 which is also a statistic.Both B0 and B one are estimating Parameters.They're estimating beta zero and beta one.So because we're estimating two parameters,We're introducing error into our calculation, we compensate bytaking away degrees of freedom. So the reason why it's N -2 isbecause we're estimating two parameters when we use white hatbest wayif we had non simple regression and introduced another one wewould need to compensate and provide the appropriate degreesof freedom there. Okay,so where are we gonna find this quantity because it's not gonnabe fun to do this with the formula, which you do have onyour formula card, which when we asked the students always wantto use the formula but you can use ourthis quantity#####is right here.The residual standard air,this is your s your standard deviation for the regression.The averagesizeof the residual.You're swhat does it mean? What's the interpretation of it?Well, a residual is measuring how far away is the predictedfrom the observe. And we're getting a sense ofwhat is that average size of the residual.So we would estimate that the observe whyIt's about126point62 cents away fromthe predicted why measuring that distance between the observedand the predicted on average? As you did see some of theseresiduals were large, others were small.But on average this is how far your observed quantities arefrom the predictedabout this much away.And this standard erroris what we get to useto findthe the standard error for our statistic.So let's do that, shall weone step closer.Is there a significant relationshipmeaning slope? What happens if if your slope is zero?What happens if your slip is zero?Flat line doesn't matter what X is?It's not related to why it's not helping you explain why?Right. So is there a significantrelationship status quo? There is no relationship, your flat,your line is flatalternative. There is a relationship, you'readding some sort of slope to this line.X. Is helping you make betterpredictions because it is related to your why?So when we are asking assessing about the significantrelationship between the two variables you've selected, wewant to test theories about the slope.H not is going to suggest scatter points.No relationship. It doesn't matter what X.Is why it's not getting any better in terms of thepredictions, because there's no relationship alternative.Here's one possible#####relationship.A positive relationship. It could be negative, right? Itcould be a little weaker, a little bit more strong.But there is a relationshipbecause it's quantitative data. What type of test that we'regoing to use?T test? So, let's compute our test statistic.We're gonna use a T. Test and we're also going toconstruct a confidence interval. C.F zeros in there or not.Shall we do it?It's not too bad. So let's work through it.It is going to be a T. It is going to measure how faraway is our statistic, which is our sample slopefrom the null value, which happens to be zero.Most of the time. Sometimes you might have toadjust it divided bythe standard errorof that slope.I'm not even gonna show you the formula for the standard air.It is on the formula card. It is very convoluted more thanI would like, but it does use that sample standard deviationfor the regression, but I'm not even gonna show it to youbecause you'll see it all comes from our output.Okay,if H that is true, we are going to be using a T.Distribution how many degrees of freedom?Simple Regression and -2.We're estimating two things. We have to adjust the degrees offreedom accordinglyAnd -1 were always only estimating sigma.So that's why it was only one. But now we're estimating twothings.So let's conduct our test.Here we go.Is there a significant relationshipbetween our x apartment size and rymonthly rent price for this population of listings in thecity. In other words, status quo isgonna suggestNo relationship, beta one equal zero.There#####is no relationship between these two variables in thispopulationalternative is gonna suggestthere is a relationship, so it should be not equal to zero.So beta one representsthe population slopebetween apartment sizeand monthly rent priceforthe populationof listingsin this particular city, whatever city it is.And this is where you want to pay attention for the next threeminutes because it will save you a headache later on.So now that we have our h not an Rh a let's go ahead and performthe test,right, So let's perform the testt how far away is the one from the null value, which in ourcase is zero and we're gonna divide that by the standarderror of our statistic.We are testing theories aboutthe slope.Hence when we look at the our output,we're going to focus onthe slope.Okaywe're testing theories about the slope.Let's focus there.So b. One is your sample slope.So there's my sample slope. There's B 1.8303.How far away it is from zero.And I'm gonna measure this with the right standard air which isright here.There's my standard air. That's why I didn't show you theformula. But it is in the formula card.If you're curious about how it was computed.So it's .2366.Furthermore. What do you see in the nextcolumn?The T. Value3.509. There's your t.value right there.T. Test statistic valuefurthermore. What do you see in the nextcolor?Very weird labeling. We haven't seen that before butit does a probability greater than absolute value of T.What do you think that meansthe p value?Right? So this last column hereis your p valuebut it is greater#####than the absolute value of your teststatistic. Which implies it isa two sided P valley. Always always two sided.Can never go around that. Always two sided.So with that let's evaluate the p value and clickinevaluatewhat do we do when we evaluate a P value,we quantify the evidence against the null.That's it. That's all we do when weevaluate.So there's my P value. How much evidence do I haveagainst the north?Everything comes from our output.We don't even have to use shiny app anymore.All right. It's all there everything islisted as long as you know where to look.If you don't know where to look, you're gonna go straight to theformula card and you're gonna get all these formulas and thenyou're gonna spend a lot of time trying to put those piecestogether when it's all just in the art output.Okay. Sothat something will practice in the next lab.So how much evidence evaluate when we evaluate? The only thingwe want is for you to quantify the evidence against the null.So how much evidence do we havestrong evidence?P value isBetween 5% and1%. So we have strong evidence.Good. That's it.That's all we want. When they evaluatewhat's the secondidea that gets lumped in to evaluate,write a conclusionright. We started with the claimlooking at whether there is a relationship between X and Y andthis population.What are we gonna suggestbased on the data?It seems like we do have a relationship between X and Y.In this populationbased on the data? We have evidence to support this ideanotice that I don't say#####based on the data.Yes.There is a relationship but I or I don't say there is arelationship.It's always very ambiguous right? Based on the data.This is what I can suggest.I might be wrong but this is what I will suggest based on thedatabecause I was readingdrafts yesterday and I keptreading very strong statements yes.Even though your P value is very very very very very tiny.We're still not proving H A is trueright based on the data. This is what I'm suggesting.Okay,so be careful with your wording. Even if your P value is veryvery very very small.So there's my conclusion.If I were to construct a confidence interval for myslope,Do you think this interval is going to contain zeroclick indiscuss with your neighborthink about what we've done in the past in terms of intervalsand testing in the connection between these two.What do we think?Will this interval contain the value of zeroclickinglink everything together that we've done put it all togetherbefore we construct the interval.And that would be the last thing we do.Let's construct an intervallots of us are saying no,we are supporting that alternative.And the alternative is suggesting that there is arelationship meaning that slope is something else other thanzero. So when we construct thisinterval to estimate the slope, that interval probably doesn'thave zero. Let's confirm.Shall welet's construct an interval.What is always in the middle of the intervalyour point estimate your statistic.So right in the middle of this interval is my point estimateof my population slope.My statistic.My sample slopeto that I'm gonna add#####and subtracta margin of error which is half the width of the interval.And that margin of error is composed of two things.The standard air and a T. Star.The T. Star is always going to comefrom the T. Table.At least the tools I've given you is always from the table andwe're gonna use and minus two degrees of freedom.Ready to construct the interval.That's the last thing we'll doand thenstart our breakafter we do the period.So let's construct this interval.B one plus or minus T. StarStandard error of B one.The most common error.T star T value. Are these the same thing?No. So my T.Star will always come from the table.So find for me the T. Star quantity.How many degrees of freedomfor regression? Always simple regression, simple regression,which is us always and minus two.We have eight listings so our degrees of freedomsixsample sizes eight. So let's put it all together,find for me that T. Star quantity.And remember the standard error is right here.There's a standard errorofmy slope.So .2366.What did y'all get for that? T star2.44seven.So right in the middle is my statistic to that I'm adding andsubtracting a margin of errorof.57896 which gives me an intervalthat hopefully does not contain zero and it doesn'tfor every increase inapartment size, we expect to see an increase in monthly rentprice that ranges between 0.25, 25 cents and a dollar and41 cents.RightBased on this 95% confidence interval.Good.And one last thing,last last. Let's see how we do.We've been working with intervals for a while.This is the last time#####we're going to interpret aninterpretation of the level last timeculmination.Do we think the following statement is correct? Whathappens if we construct many many manyintervals?Is this correct?Is the last time.So really think about it.Read it carefully.This is like a check. Yes, I understand confidencelevels. We've been doing it for so long.I finally nailed it. I got it.Or I need to review that. Very important concept.What do we thinkthe level that idea of constructing manymany intervals.What happens to these manymany intervals?one last self assessment.What do we think?And I know it's just random guessing because it truly is 5149.It doesn't get any more random than that.Sodiscuss with your neighbors.What do we think? It is?It's kind of like your seal of approval.Yes. you're done.You've understood level. Focus on something else now oryou need to review the last few chapters where we've beentalking about level constantly.So what do we think?Look at thisand I'll show youthe results. So you see, I'm not lying.It doesn't get more random than that.Right?Is this enough evidence that there's random selection?Defin. I couldn't plan it any better.5050 between these two.So I'll give you one more chance.Try it out again.The one show the resultsdiscuss. Think about itlast time you'll see a level of interpretationIn generic terms. What happens if you have manyintervals approximately what 95% of the intervals.Do whatWhat do these, 95% of the intervals do?I'm curious to see the resultsso I'm gonna stop it and I will see it.How do we explain this?The end of the semesterWe've seen levels so many#####times. I can pull up homer 567.There's a level in every single one of these homeworksevery single one of them.Right? So there's something going on here.Is this right?No, this is not correct. You can always always alwayswrite an interpretation of the level before you even look atyour data before you even construct an interval because itdoes not allude to the one interval you have.It talks about the many intervals and how the manyintervals containyour population parameter. The many many intervals aregoing to contain that population parameter.So we don't include that.The reason why this method is reliable is because if we havemany intervals a high percentage of these intervals contain theparameter. That's whyI don't have to look at the data.I don't have to look at that interval to write theinterpretation at the level. The last time we see it, pleasereview before that exam because it's one of those keyinterpretations that we should understand.Okayand we'll stop here.Have a wonderful break. Please take some time todecompress.Be ready to review your interpretation of the levelbefore exam two.Uh huh.
Hello.It's thursday almost break almost.We have a homework due tonight at 11 59.Make sure you get it in. Uh We have some office hourstoday in person and remote. We have one hour of remotehours. Um Stop by.We're here to help. UmThis assignmentcovers a lot you know a lot of what we've been doing in thepast few weeks. So it's a good indication ofwhat you might want to focus on reviewing versus stuff thatyou've completely understoodAnd you can focus on something else.Um your drafts were due last night if you did not get it inand there is a good chunk of you who did not turn them in lastnight. You do have until today at noon.Well 1230 to get those um drafts in through canvas with aone point deduction after that you will not be getting creditfor the draft.Um If you don't turn in your draft through canvas it will notbe part of the peer review process.You will not get any feedback from your peers.The peer reviews are going to open at 12 45andyou can get those done before you take off for your break.Okay technically they're due next week on Tuesday but I wouldencourage you all to get them done before you start yourbreak. That way you can completely takea pause from stats to 50 for a week because there really isnothing to do next week. If you complete the peer reviewsbefore you take off for a break. Okay get those done,invest an hour, get them done and then that's#####it you're done.Don't procrastinate. Be good to your future selves.Okay? And I also encourage you that while you're here, you'realso good to your future selves. You're investing an hour and ahalf. Work through the ideas thatwe're working through in lecture.Hence you don't have to reinvest this time later on after thebreak because you're doing it now.Okay. Otherwise it's double timeand that's one thing that we often lack time.Okay so make sure that you're here invested.Work through the problems with me, understand ask questionsabout regression focused. I know it's hard in these daysto stay focused, butt focused, get something out of it.You're here for an hour and a half.Don't invest this time yet again afterthe lecture. Okay, highly highly recommendthatumnext week we have no labs, no lectures, no office hours otherthan m right fellows have a few office hours on Tuesday toanswer any peer review questions you might have.But other than that nothing. No new homework opens tonight.We truly want you to take a break,decompressed for a week before you come back and wrap up thesemester and do a strong finish. Okay,Shall we go through regression.So a few things we need to wrap up, we won't get through it alltoday. But that's okay.So regression is looking at the relationship between twoquantitative variables. we have to have two quantitativevariablesand their order for us to get a visual, which is always thefirst step in data analysis, understand your data, visualizethe data, explore the data in order for us to get a visual ofthis#####relationship between these two variables.We're going to use a scatter plot.And as you've noticed by now we are almost at the end of thesemester. Every time we have a graphicaldisplay, we have to include some sort of commentary about what wesee in the graphical display. You did that with? Em right.You have your side by side box plot in your draft.You needed to provide something for the readers.What is it that they should focus on in that plot.You did the same thing with the hissed a gram of thedifferences. Right.What was so meaningful about that, hissed a gram.What are positive differences? What are negative differences?Why are you looking at differences Because of thedependent scenario?So the same thing goes with the scatter plot.When we have our scatter plot, we're going to be conveying theidea of a form? What type of relationship in terms of itsform do we see between these two variables? What is thedirection? What is the strength? And are there any outliers thatyou think? Might there be any outliers? So always use thatvague language because we don't give you the tools to decidewhether something is an outlier or not.We want to hear your perspective of that.Okay,now, when it comes to the strength for your description itis subjective, What is it that you consider strong versus weakversus moderately strong or moderately weak.But then there's also a summary that quantifies that strengthand that's your correlation coefficient.The magnitude of that correlation coefficientis the strength of the association.The closer that magnitude is to#####one,the stronger the association, the closer than magnitude is tozero the weaker the association. That correlation coefficientalso provides a positive in the negative direction of theassociationand then everything we do as you'll see today will have thisvery long formulasthat students will gravitate and want to use however our providesall these key components if you know where to look.So regression is one of those um topics that really relies onnavigating and knowing your way around our output becauseeverything is there, as long as you know where to look as you'llsee today. Okay, so from this regressionoutput we can pick up the linear relationship, themodel, the equation of the line, here's my y interceptand that also provides the slope for mefrom the output.You can get this equation of the line, we went through how tocalculate that equation of the line with formulas but you canjust pick it up from here. Okay,sounds good,what else are we going to do?We're going to dive deep into this correlation coefficient.Rbecause it provides this very nice idea for us.So with regression there's a lot of things you can do.The first four things is what we called descriptive regression.And we'll wrap that up today. The last three things is theinference part of regression, and we'll work through one ofthose. One of the three ideas.There? Only one. Okay, are we readyour square? Let's think about this measure.So we want to pay attention for like two minutes so that weunderstand this r. Square valuebecause this is such a key value,#####Such a key component andwe love it so much because it has a very nice intuitiveinterpretation. Okay,so fact is monthly rent prices are different,right? Even if you were to look at the same apartment size,you will get variability in monthly rent prices.Not every single apartment has the same price.We want to understand the variability of our response,which is monthly rent prices.If I only had eight listings and Ionly had information about eight monthly rent prices.These prices are going to vary. I'm not gonna get the same rentprice, gonna be variability there.If I wanted to predictthe monthly rent price for someone who's interested inrenting an apartment, what would be my best guess based on thefact that I only have access to eight listings in their monthlyrent price.What would you suggest as the best guessif you have quantitative data,only eight observations and you want to make a prediction usingthese eight observations that only include monthly rentprices, what would you predict?What would be a good educated guess?No waythe average, right. If all I had was access to eightobservations and I want to make a prediction using these eightquantitative observations, my best guess is going to be theaverageand I would make the same prediction for everyone.Just the average.The whole point of regression, though, is to understand whatcontributes to this variability in your response.And if I only have access to my response, I'm going to be makingthe same prediction all the time,but we know that prices of apartments, rent, prices varyand that variability is due#####to many factors, some of it isapartment size. What are other factors thatcontribute to the variability in monthly rent prices? What do youthink?I'm sure you all look for apartments? Right.As college students, that's part of being a student, you have tofind a place to live. Right.So what factors contribute to the variability wesee in monthly rent prices? What have you noticed?Location? Right. Location is definitely a factorthat contributes to that, what elsesize,number of bedrooms,what elseamenities? Right.The age of the building?Right. Very old buildings versus newbuildings,parking? Does they have parking or not, that contributes to thevariability and monthly rent prices.So there's all these factors that contribute to thevariability of monthly rent prices.And my job is to understand that variability of monthly rentprices. But the way I'm going tounderstand it is by selecting one of the many factors becauseof simple regression. So I only have one variable thatI can use. Right?So when we look at this variability of our monthly rentprice is really composed of two things is composed by thevariability that is explained by the variable you'veselectedand the variability that's left unexplained because it's due toother factors. So in our case the variabilityof monthly rent priceis some portion of that is explained by the apartment sizeand some other portion is left unexplained because it's due tolocation amenities, age of the building.Does it have parking or not? So this r square quantity is suchan important measure for us because it has a very niceintuitive idea.It is a quantity between zero and 1#####which implies it is aproportionand it is a proportion of the variability in the response thatis actually explained by the one variable you selected.So if this proportion is closer to one,what does that tell you about the explanatory variable youselected?Is it explaining a lot of that variability.Yeah, there's a very few variability left.Unaccounted for by that explanatory variable.If that correlation coefficient, if that r square value is closerto zero,then that explanatory variable you selected to understand thevariability of that response is not that great,right? It's not accounting for a lot of that variability.It's not explaining a lot of that variability.So let's look at this value where we find it in our outputand how do we interpret it?So where are we gonna find this? R square quantity?It's part of the coefficients outputand right under it are some numerical summaries,some of which are your art score quantities, one is the adjustedR square. We never use this one.The adjusted is used when you have a model that has more thanone explanatory variable because you can think of creating amodel that includes all your explanatory variables.Right? If you had access to that and it would be a very goodmodel. But then you have to adjust theart square because in your square quantity would be oneand that can be. So you need to adjust it.So that's what the adjusted R square is for.So we don't use it because we're using simple regression.So our our square isthe multiple are square. There it is.So what does this#####number tell you? In our example, itsuggests that 67.24of the variation. In my response is actuallyexplained by the relationship it has with the explanatoryvariable.In other words, 67.24% of thevariation in monthly rent price, which iswhat we are trying to understandis explained by the relationship it has withapartment size,67%of the variation we see in these monthly rent prices is actuallydue to the fact that you're looking at different apartmentsizesAbout 67%.The other 32% is left unexplained that other32% is due to location amenities, theage of the building, whether it has a park parking or not, theother 32% is not accounted for with this model.Does that make sense in terms of our art square, such a beautifulnumber and we love it so much because of this intuitive ideathat alludes to how good of a model you have.Is it a good model? Did you pick the right explanatory variable?Well, let's look at this Art square quantity and see whetherwe did select an appropriate explanatory variable of the manywe could have chosengood.Now, if we have the R square quantity, can we compute thecorrelation coefficient? Rwhat do you think?Probably right. Because we're not always gonnahave access to data, especially at an exam setting.Hence we can't just use the core function to compute thiscorrelation coefficient. So we have to use output in onepossibility is to use the r square quantity to compute ourcorrelation coefficient. It is going to be the squareroot of our square.I do want to add to this the plus or minus to remindourselves to#####always checkis it a positive direction or is it a negative direction? Andwe're gonna check using either the sign of the slopeor the direction of the scatter plot or inin our case, what type of direction do we haveslope is positive. We looked at the scatter plotand we said it was a positive direction.So we do have a positive directionpositive correlation coefficient because that positive negativegives you the direction and then square root of r R squarequantity.Always multiple are square. Never adjusted .6724.So we getOur Correlation Coefficient .82.So from the r square quantity we can get the correlationcoefficient,which is what you would do on a homework or an exam where wewant to provide some output. That provides lots of pieces ofinformation rather than the direct output of the correlationfunction. Okay, yes,that's still white.So our square measures. So when do we use our squareversus our both are alluding to the strength of the associationbetween x and y. Are square provides themagnitude provides the strength and it also provides thedirection.That's what the correlation coefficient gives us from forour model,Our square howevergives you that I concept but without the positive and thenegative. But it has a very niceinterpretation because your art square quantity is from 0 to 1and it's a proportion. The closer that proportion is tooneimplies that your explanatory variable is doing a very goodjob at explaining all the variability you see in yourresponse.Which is by definition what we are trying to do withregression.Why are we using regression tolook at the relationship#####between your X and your Y.Hmmdirection,squarestrength.So the R. R correlation are always givesyou a direction which is not what you get from our square.What you get from our square. Is this nice interpretation thatalludes to the original goal of regression which is tounderstand the variability of your response by including amodel that has many explanatory variables.Good.Last things about descriptive regression.Before we move on toinference,nonlinear relationshipsalways visualize your data are will always create a linearmodel for you. Even if the relationship is notlinear. So as step one, you always needto visualize explore your data. You did that with em.Right, you're gonna continue to do that provide the rightgraphical displays to understand your data before you conductyour analysis.Outliers, outliers could influence your regressionline.It could be quite influential. So we don't give you the toolsto understand outliers. Um We simply want you to commenton whether you have outliers or not, potential outliers in yourdata set or not?But they could steer your analysis in one direction oranotherand then the other one is dangers of extrapolating.When we do regression analysis,you can only make predictions within the range of X.If you make predictions outside the range of X, then you don'treally know what the china is going to continue to be.That's different analysis, but not with regression.With regression. It really is only for the rangeof X. Otherwise you're extrapolatingand then you have to do further analysis.Okay, so here's an exampleof extrapolation. What's gonna happen in the21 56 Olympics for sprintersshould be sprint, nice spring.What's gonna happen?We#####have winning timesFor sprinters and then eight and then year not eight year.And they have records for the Olympics.Up to this was up to 1996. They gave you an r squaredquantity for males in our square quantity for females.And what did they decide to do extend the line? So that in theyear 21,which is what they're predicting something great is gonna happen.Finally, women and men are gonna run just as fast.There's not going to be a difference,but why do we stop there? What would be even a better headline?What is it?Huh?With women actually run faster than men? Furthermore, whenwe can do winning time inzero seconds. Right?Furthermore winning a race innegative time. Right? Why stop at the year 2156. Right.So this isan example of extrapolation. You don't extrapolate.You don't know what's gonna happen.You don't have information for that.Okay. There's no need why you need tostop at 21 56. You can even make a betterheadline if you actually continue further into the futurebased on their analysis. Okay.The other one is dangerous of combining groupsinappropriately.So, a school district wanted to understand what the optimalduration of study is for students to achieve satisfactoryresults.So they asked teachers various classes to do a survey amongtheir students and they plotted the results of the survey thatlooked at the preparation hours and then their final percentage.What do you noticenegative direction?Right? Strong relationship.It looks. Okay.Right.What would be a message based on this plotstudy? Lessperform better?Does that make sense?Should I be advertising that to my students study less? You'llperform better.Yes.Quality#####versus quantity. That's what I should be.Advertising quality of study versus quantity of study.So what's going on,what do we thinkthey did ask teachers? Various subjects.So, of course, some subjects require more versus less.Right. So, if you actually look at eachsubject,you see why you see this type of relationship.It doesn't make sense because the data was combinedinappropriately. There's confounding factors herethat don't really highlight what's going on.You should be analyzing this data separately by subject.Okay, so that's what we mean by Simpson's paradox.And then the last thing is even if the correlation is exactlyonewhich is unheard of. But even if you cannot say thatX is causing Y to occurthe different analysis and conversation is very hard toprovide a convincing argument for.Okay.Okay.And that isit for descriptive analysis.Shall we practice it? Going back to our long eyelashes? We havethree questions you get to work through and click in.Think about what we've seen so far.Check. Did I understand these lastitems. Do I know where to look in ouroutput to come up with these ideas? One less thing to worryabout after the break in terms of studying for that exam.If not ask raise your hand,ask away.Try it out.You're here. And that's that time check.Do I know how to answer these questions If it were to appearon homework eight that I consume through the hallmarkor one less thing to study for that exam which is intwo weeks if you don't count. Thanksgivingthere's a clicker for the correlation.Be good to your future selves. There's not much time#####left inthe semesterare you justso what's the correlation between these two quantitativevariables.How are we gonna find this correlation?Have your correlation coefficient? Go ahead and clickin decide which one matches your core correlation coefficientbased on the clickers.So we want the correlation between these two quantitativevariables, which implies we want the correlation coefficient.RIf we don't have the data set in front of us, we can't use thatcore function to compute this correlation coefficient like wewould in lab after the break.So where are we going to get that correlation coefficient? Rlucky for us this our output provides the R square and we'renever going to use the adjusted R squarebecause that implies that we have more than one explanatoryvariable. If we had more than oneexplanatory variable we would be using that adjusted R square butthat's not our case. We have simple regression.One explanatory variable. We go with the multiple aresquareplus or minus square root of our square.Is it going to be positive or negative?The slope will determine the sign based on the slope we havea positive direction. So it's gonna be a positiveassociation. You can look at the slope.You can also look at the scatter plot.6069giving meA correlation coefficient of.779.and only about 60% of us got that.The other common answer was aand a is your R square quantity, which is not the correlationcoefficient.Should I add units to this quantity?No, the correlation coefficient is a unit less quantity.No units.If I were to change all of my data and convert it tomilligrams, I will still get#####the same correlation coefficient of.779. No units.Okay.Ready to try the next one.What is this asking for?This is an interpretation ofare squareSo we can pick up our square from the output.There it is 60.69% of the variationin the response is explained by the relationship thisresponse has with the explanatory variable.My response is whateyelash with lengthand my explanatory variable isthe eye withSo 60.69% of the variations I have inthese responses in these eyelash lengths that I have in my datais actually explained by the fact that we're looking atdifferent umeyes of different sizes.The rest is left unexplained by this factor.Some other thing is explaining the restgood.And finally the last oneclicker.What do we think about this one? Giraffes?The eye with of giraffes um of a giraffe was measured and foundto be 4.08 cm.Should we use this model to predict the eyelash length forgiraffes?Yes or no. Would it be valid? We can alwaysdo it right but is it valid?It's a formula. So we can always plug stuff intothe formula and outcome some sort of predicted value but isthat predicted value meaningful or valid for the analysis?Go ahead and discusswith your neighbors please.And that's the time that you're in herebe good to your future selves. You're here for an hour,understand regression. One less thing that you have toworry about for that exam that's coming up soon.The hardest part was getting here.Now that you're herestay focused for an hour.You already did the hard part which issnowing and you're here.Now let's gain something out of it.Okayso can#####we do thiswhen we make predictions? We should always be makingpredictions withinthe range of our explanatory variable.So if you look at the scatter plot, is this outside the rangeor inside the range of my explanatory variable?It is outside the range. So hence we cannot use thismodel to make predictions for giraffes.So we're not gonna use it because it is outside the rangeof my explanatory variable which is i with this isextrapolating an example of extrapolatinggood.We are done with the descriptive side of regression.Now comesthe inference.The new stuff for a lot of us.So let's pretend for a second that instead of just having asample of observations, I actually had apopulation of observations. The entire population data set.What would my scattered plot look like?I wouldn't just have eight xy combinations.I would have for every single listing in the city.I would have all of those xy combinations.So my scatter plot would have lots and lots and lots and lotsof lots of dots.If I actually had population data, I could fit a linearmodel through that population dataand that linear model would bethe true regression line.The true population regression linewhich only exists ifI had population data, which I don't I always work with sampledatabut that line does exist.What have we done so far with inference? We take our sampleand a statistic and we always want to learn about thepopulation parameter.The same thing applies to regression is just a little bittrickier. But the same idea appliesif we actually had population data we would have aregression model#####for this population data.So this one requires population data.What we have access to thoseis sample data.So my best guess as to what that population model might be is theone I create using my sample. So this one only requiressample data.So it's analogous to having a sample and finding a statisticthat's estimating the population parameter.That is unknown.So this true line is that population idea that does existif you had population data and your best guess is based onsample data, which is that sample version of a regressionline.Now that population data, the population regression line ismade up of Parameters. So beta zero is your true.Why interceptfor the population of interest.We don't have population data. So we always use our statistic,B0 is your statistic which will vary from sample to sample.Because if I had different observations, I'll create adifferent regression line. So this is my sample, yinterceptand it variesfrom sample to samplejust like every statistic.The same thing happens with slope.Beta one is my parameter and that's my populationslope. Which requires population datain order to know its quantity. And the best guess for thatpopulation slope is my sample slope.My statistic.So we still have this idea of parameter versus statistic isjust a little bit different from what we are used tobecausewe have an equation of the line that we're estimating basically.Okay, using the sample.Now when we do inference, where are we gonna go with this?We are going to assess if we have a linear relationshipbetween the X and the Y. The explanatory variable in theresponse.#####If we're assessingLinking it back to homework seven.The last question, if we are assessing a claim,what type of inference method should we usea test of an interval?When you read those options on question nine of homework seven,if you're assessing a claim, what method are you going to beusing a test or an interval?A test? Right. So when we assess if we have alinear relationship, we're going to conducta hypothesis test.We're also going to be providing intervals around our estimates.After all this data. This regression line, Thissample regression line is based on a sample data and if I had adifferent sample, I would have a different sample line.So instead of just providing a predicted quantity, like we'vebeen doing, we're gonna construct intervals around ourpredictions and talk about the different types of intervals wecan have.And then the last thing is assumptions.That's always the last thing you do in regression because youneed the model.So let's start with the first one.Shall wetake a break before we start?Yes,two minute break, stretch. Come back.Focus for the last part. So you have one less thing toreview after thanksgiving.You don't wannaaccumulate things.Okay, shall we start?Yes,So we're gonna conduct a testwhich means we have to have some sort ofMeasure of variability. Okay, so going back toway back, Chapter two, a standard deviation.That standard deviation measured the average distance of anobservation to the mean, a typical observation to the meat.That's what that standard deviation provided for us.It turns out that regression also has its own standarddeviation,but it's not the same#####as what we had before.So that standard deviation is looking at the average size ofthe residual on average. How far away are your observedvalues from the predicted? If you notice all of these lines,horizontal lines are your residualsfrom Tuesday residuals areyour errors.Some of these residualsare quite large, we were way off for some um predictions.Some of them are very small. We were almost there some mighteven be zero right on target. Right? So we want to get a senseof the average size of these residuals, Some are big, someare small. What is the average sizeroughly? How far off is your estimate from that observedquantity?So that's what we're gonna call the standard deviation for theregression. So it is an average size whichmeans it's going to be adding thingsanddividing by a total right? That's how you find average toadd things up and divide by a totalby definition. That's how you do an average,it is the average size of the residual the error term.How do we find each error term? We look at the observation.How far away is that observation fromthe predicted value?Here's your observation and here's your predictedand you're measuring the distance between those two.The residual observed minus predicted.And you're doing that for every observation because you want toget that average size of these residuals.So here's the second one.Why? To how far away it is from its predicted quantity.Let's just go to the last one.The last observation, how far away it is fromit's predicted quantity.Now, if we leave it as is some#####of these errors are positive,some are negative because sometimes we overestimatesometimes we underestimate. So if we were to just computethese errors and add them up, we would getzero things canceled out. What's her quick fix?Square?We've always done that.So let's square everything.And if we're squaringwe need to unscrew air so we need to take the square root ofitand nowthe sample sizeIt is true that to find an average you have to divide by atotal. However our total is not goingto be in, it is going to be N -2.We're losing 2° of freedom.The reason for that is every time we include an estimate intoour measurements we need to compensate for introducing errorby taking away a degree of freedom.Where are we introducing estimates.When we find white hatWe're using B0 which is a statistic.And we're using B1 which is also a statistic.Both B0 and B one are estimating Parameters.They're estimating beta zero and beta one.So because we're estimating two parameters,We're introducing error into our calculation, we compensate bytaking away degrees of freedom. So the reason why it's N -2 isbecause we're estimating two parameters when we use white hatbest wayif we had non simple regression and introduced another one wewould need to compensate and provide the appropriate degreesof freedom there. Okay,so where are we gonna find this quantity because it's not gonnabe fun to do this with the formula, which you do have onyour formula card, which when we asked the students always wantto use the formula but you can use ourthis quantity#####is right here.The residual standard air,this is your s your standard deviation for the regression.The averagesizeof the residual.You're swhat does it mean? What's the interpretation of it?Well, a residual is measuring how far away is the predictedfrom the observe. And we're getting a sense ofwhat is that average size of the residual.So we would estimate that the observe whyIt's about126point62 cents away fromthe predicted why measuring that distance between the observedand the predicted on average? As you did see some of theseresiduals were large, others were small.But on average this is how far your observed quantities arefrom the predictedabout this much away.And this standard erroris what we get to useto findthe the standard error for our statistic.So let's do that, shall weone step closer.Is there a significant relationshipmeaning slope? What happens if if your slope is zero?What happens if your slip is zero?Flat line doesn't matter what X is?It's not related to why it's not helping you explain why?Right. So is there a significantrelationship status quo? There is no relationship, your flat,your line is flatalternative. There is a relationship, you'readding some sort of slope to this line.X. Is helping you make betterpredictions because it is related to your why?So when we are asking assessing about the significantrelationship between the two variables you've selected, wewant to test theories about the slope.H not is going to suggest scatter points.No relationship. It doesn't matter what X.Is why it's not getting any better in terms of thepredictions, because there's no relationship alternative.Here's one possible#####relationship.A positive relationship. It could be negative, right? Itcould be a little weaker, a little bit more strong.But there is a relationshipbecause it's quantitative data. What type of test that we'regoing to use?T test? So, let's compute our test statistic.We're gonna use a T. Test and we're also going toconstruct a confidence interval. C.F zeros in there or not.Shall we do it?It's not too bad. So let's work through it.It is going to be a T. It is going to measure how faraway is our statistic, which is our sample slopefrom the null value, which happens to be zero.Most of the time. Sometimes you might have toadjust it divided bythe standard errorof that slope.I'm not even gonna show you the formula for the standard air.It is on the formula card. It is very convoluted more thanI would like, but it does use that sample standard deviationfor the regression, but I'm not even gonna show it to youbecause you'll see it all comes from our output.Okay,if H that is true, we are going to be using a T.Distribution how many degrees of freedom?Simple Regression and -2.We're estimating two things. We have to adjust the degrees offreedom accordinglyAnd -1 were always only estimating sigma.So that's why it was only one. But now we're estimating twothings.So let's conduct our test.Here we go.Is there a significant relationshipbetween our x apartment size and rymonthly rent price for this population of listings in thecity. In other words, status quo isgonna suggestNo relationship, beta one equal zero.There#####is no relationship between these two variables in thispopulationalternative is gonna suggestthere is a relationship, so it should be not equal to zero.So beta one representsthe population slopebetween apartment sizeand monthly rent priceforthe populationof listingsin this particular city, whatever city it is.And this is where you want to pay attention for the next threeminutes because it will save you a headache later on.So now that we have our h not an Rh a let's go ahead and performthe test,right, So let's perform the testt how far away is the one from the null value, which in ourcase is zero and we're gonna divide that by the standarderror of our statistic.We are testing theories aboutthe slope.Hence when we look at the our output,we're going to focus onthe slope.Okaywe're testing theories about the slope.Let's focus there.So b. One is your sample slope.So there's my sample slope. There's B 1.8303.How far away it is from zero.And I'm gonna measure this with the right standard air which isright here.There's my standard air. That's why I didn't show you theformula. But it is in the formula card.If you're curious about how it was computed.So it's .2366.Furthermore. What do you see in the nextcolumn?The T. Value3.509. There's your t.value right there.T. Test statistic valuefurthermore. What do you see in the nextcolor?Very weird labeling. We haven't seen that before butit does a probability greater than absolute value of T.What do you think that meansthe p value?Right? So this last column hereis your p valuebut it is greater#####than the absolute value of your teststatistic. Which implies it isa two sided P valley. Always always two sided.Can never go around that. Always two sided.So with that let's evaluate the p value and clickinevaluatewhat do we do when we evaluate a P value,we quantify the evidence against the null.That's it. That's all we do when weevaluate.So there's my P value. How much evidence do I haveagainst the north?Everything comes from our output.We don't even have to use shiny app anymore.All right. It's all there everything islisted as long as you know where to look.If you don't know where to look, you're gonna go straight to theformula card and you're gonna get all these formulas and thenyou're gonna spend a lot of time trying to put those piecestogether when it's all just in the art output.Okay. Sothat something will practice in the next lab.So how much evidence evaluate when we evaluate? The only thingwe want is for you to quantify the evidence against the null.So how much evidence do we havestrong evidence?P value isBetween 5% and1%. So we have strong evidence.Good. That's it.That's all we want. When they evaluatewhat's the secondidea that gets lumped in to evaluate,write a conclusionright. We started with the claimlooking at whether there is a relationship between X and Y andthis population.What are we gonna suggestbased on the data?It seems like we do have a relationship between X and Y.In this populationbased on the data? We have evidence to support this ideanotice that I don't say#####based on the data.Yes.There is a relationship but I or I don't say there is arelationship.It's always very ambiguous right? Based on the data.This is what I can suggest.I might be wrong but this is what I will suggest based on thedatabecause I was readingdrafts yesterday and I keptreading very strong statements yes.Even though your P value is very very very very very tiny.We're still not proving H A is trueright based on the data. This is what I'm suggesting.Okay,so be careful with your wording. Even if your P value is veryvery very very small.So there's my conclusion.If I were to construct a confidence interval for myslope,Do you think this interval is going to contain zeroclick indiscuss with your neighborthink about what we've done in the past in terms of intervalsand testing in the connection between these two.What do we think?Will this interval contain the value of zeroclickinglink everything together that we've done put it all togetherbefore we construct the interval.And that would be the last thing we do.Let's construct an intervallots of us are saying no,we are supporting that alternative.And the alternative is suggesting that there is arelationship meaning that slope is something else other thanzero. So when we construct thisinterval to estimate the slope, that interval probably doesn'thave zero. Let's confirm.Shall welet's construct an interval.What is always in the middle of the intervalyour point estimate your statistic.So right in the middle of this interval is my point estimateof my population slope.My statistic.My sample slopeto that I'm gonna add#####and subtracta margin of error which is half the width of the interval.And that margin of error is composed of two things.The standard air and a T. Star.The T. Star is always going to comefrom the T. Table.At least the tools I've given you is always from the table andwe're gonna use and minus two degrees of freedom.Ready to construct the interval.That's the last thing we'll doand thenstart our breakafter we do the period.So let's construct this interval.B one plus or minus T. StarStandard error of B one.The most common error.T star T value. Are these the same thing?No. So my T.Star will always come from the table.So find for me the T. Star quantity.How many degrees of freedomfor regression? Always simple regression, simple regression,which is us always and minus two.We have eight listings so our degrees of freedomsixsample sizes eight. So let's put it all together,find for me that T. Star quantity.And remember the standard error is right here.There's a standard errorofmy slope.So .2366.What did y'all get for that? T star2.44seven.So right in the middle is my statistic to that I'm adding andsubtracting a margin of errorof.57896 which gives me an intervalthat hopefully does not contain zero and it doesn'tfor every increase inapartment size, we expect to see an increase in monthly rentprice that ranges between 0.25, 25 cents and a dollar and41 cents.RightBased on this 95% confidence interval.Good.And one last thing,last last. Let's see how we do.We've been working with intervals for a while.This is the last time#####we're going to interpret aninterpretation of the level last timeculmination.Do we think the following statement is correct? Whathappens if we construct many many manyintervals?Is this correct?Is the last time.So really think about it.Read it carefully.This is like a check. Yes, I understand confidencelevels. We've been doing it for so long.I finally nailed it. I got it.Or I need to review that. Very important concept.What do we thinkthe level that idea of constructing manymany intervals.What happens to these manymany intervals?one last self assessment.What do we think?And I know it's just random guessing because it truly is 5149.It doesn't get any more random than that.Sodiscuss with your neighbors.What do we think? It is?It's kind of like your seal of approval.Yes. you're done.You've understood level. Focus on something else now oryou need to review the last few chapters where we've beentalking about level constantly.So what do we think?Look at thisand I'll show youthe results. So you see, I'm not lying.It doesn't get more random than that.Right?Is this enough evidence that there's random selection?Defin. I couldn't plan it any better.5050 between these two.So I'll give you one more chance.Try it out again.The one show the resultsdiscuss. Think about itlast time you'll see a level of interpretationIn generic terms. What happens if you have manyintervals approximately what 95% of the intervals.Do whatWhat do these, 95% of the intervals do?I'm curious to see the resultsso I'm gonna stop it and I will see it.How do we explain this?The end of the semesterWe've seen levels so many#####times. I can pull up homer 567.There's a level in every single one of these homeworksevery single one of them.Right? So there's something going on here.Is this right?No, this is not correct. You can always always alwayswrite an interpretation of the level before you even look atyour data before you even construct an interval because itdoes not allude to the one interval you have.It talks about the many intervals and how the manyintervals containyour population parameter. The many many intervals aregoing to contain that population parameter.So we don't include that.The reason why this method is reliable is because if we havemany intervals a high percentage of these intervals contain theparameter. That's whyI don't have to look at the data.I don't have to look at that interval to write theinterpretation at the level. The last time we see it, pleasereview before that exam because it's one of those keyinterpretations that we should understand.Okayand we'll stop here.Have a wonderful break. Please take some time todecompress.Be ready to review your interpretation of the levelbefore exam two.Uh huh.
Hello.It's thursday almost break almost.We have a homework due tonight at 11 59.Make sure you get it in. Uh We have some office hourstoday in person and remote. We have one hour of remotehours. Um Stop by.We're here to help. UmThis assignmentcovers a lot you know a lot of what we've been doing in thepast few weeks. So it's a good indication ofwhat you might want to focus on reviewing versus stuff thatyou've completely understoodAnd you can focus on something else.Um your drafts were due last night if you did not get it inand there is a good chunk of you who did not turn them in lastnight. You do have until today at noon.Well 1230 to get those um drafts in through canvas with aone point deduction after that you will not be getting creditfor the draft.Um If you don't turn in your draft through canvas it will notbe part of the peer review process.You will not get any feedback from your peers.The peer reviews are going to open at 12 45andyou can get those done before you take off for your break.Okay technically they're due next week on Tuesday but I wouldencourage you all to get them done before you start yourbreak. That way you can completely takea pause from stats to 50 for a week because there really isnothing to do next week. If you complete the peer reviewsbefore you take off for a break. Okay get those done,invest an hour, get them done and then that's#####it you're done.Don't procrastinate. Be good to your future selves.Okay? And I also encourage you that while you're here, you'realso good to your future selves. You're investing an hour and ahalf. Work through the ideas thatwe're working through in lecture.Hence you don't have to reinvest this time later on after thebreak because you're doing it now.Okay. Otherwise it's double timeand that's one thing that we often lack time.Okay so make sure that you're here invested.Work through the problems with me, understand ask questionsabout regression focused. I know it's hard in these daysto stay focused, butt focused, get something out of it.You're here for an hour and a half.Don't invest this time yet again afterthe lecture. Okay, highly highly recommendthatumnext week we have no labs, no lectures, no office hours otherthan m right fellows have a few office hours on Tuesday toanswer any peer review questions you might have.But other than that nothing. No new homework opens tonight.We truly want you to take a break,decompressed for a week before you come back and wrap up thesemester and do a strong finish. Okay,Shall we go through regression.So a few things we need to wrap up, we won't get through it alltoday. But that's okay.So regression is looking at the relationship between twoquantitative variables. we have to have two quantitativevariablesand their order for us to get a visual, which is always thefirst step in data analysis, understand your data, visualizethe data, explore the data in order for us to get a visual ofthis#####relationship between these two variables.We're going to use a scatter plot.And as you've noticed by now we are almost at the end of thesemester. Every time we have a graphicaldisplay, we have to include some sort of commentary about what wesee in the graphical display. You did that with? Em right.You have your side by side box plot in your draft.You needed to provide something for the readers.What is it that they should focus on in that plot.You did the same thing with the hissed a gram of thedifferences. Right.What was so meaningful about that, hissed a gram.What are positive differences? What are negative differences?Why are you looking at differences Because of thedependent scenario?So the same thing goes with the scatter plot.When we have our scatter plot, we're going to be conveying theidea of a form? What type of relationship in terms of itsform do we see between these two variables? What is thedirection? What is the strength? And are there any outliers thatyou think? Might there be any outliers? So always use thatvague language because we don't give you the tools to decidewhether something is an outlier or not.We want to hear your perspective of that.Okay,now, when it comes to the strength for your description itis subjective, What is it that you consider strong versus weakversus moderately strong or moderately weak.But then there's also a summary that quantifies that strengthand that's your correlation coefficient.The magnitude of that correlation coefficientis the strength of the association.The closer that magnitude is to#####one,the stronger the association, the closer than magnitude is tozero the weaker the association. That correlation coefficientalso provides a positive in the negative direction of theassociationand then everything we do as you'll see today will have thisvery long formulasthat students will gravitate and want to use however our providesall these key components if you know where to look.So regression is one of those um topics that really relies onnavigating and knowing your way around our output becauseeverything is there, as long as you know where to look as you'llsee today. Okay, so from this regressionoutput we can pick up the linear relationship, themodel, the equation of the line, here's my y interceptand that also provides the slope for mefrom the output.You can get this equation of the line, we went through how tocalculate that equation of the line with formulas but you canjust pick it up from here. Okay,sounds good,what else are we going to do?We're going to dive deep into this correlation coefficient.Rbecause it provides this very nice idea for us.So with regression there's a lot of things you can do.The first four things is what we called descriptive regression.And we'll wrap that up today. The last three things is theinference part of regression, and we'll work through one ofthose. One of the three ideas.There? Only one. Okay, are we readyour square? Let's think about this measure.So we want to pay attention for like two minutes so that weunderstand this r. Square valuebecause this is such a key value,#####Such a key component andwe love it so much because it has a very nice intuitiveinterpretation. Okay,so fact is monthly rent prices are different,right? Even if you were to look at the same apartment size,you will get variability in monthly rent prices.Not every single apartment has the same price.We want to understand the variability of our response,which is monthly rent prices.If I only had eight listings and Ionly had information about eight monthly rent prices.These prices are going to vary. I'm not gonna get the same rentprice, gonna be variability there.If I wanted to predictthe monthly rent price for someone who's interested inrenting an apartment, what would be my best guess based on thefact that I only have access to eight listings in their monthlyrent price.What would you suggest as the best guessif you have quantitative data,only eight observations and you want to make a prediction usingthese eight observations that only include monthly rentprices, what would you predict?What would be a good educated guess?No waythe average, right. If all I had was access to eightobservations and I want to make a prediction using these eightquantitative observations, my best guess is going to be theaverageand I would make the same prediction for everyone.Just the average.The whole point of regression, though, is to understand whatcontributes to this variability in your response.And if I only have access to my response, I'm going to be makingthe same prediction all the time,but we know that prices of apartments, rent, prices varyand that variability is due#####to many factors, some of it isapartment size. What are other factors thatcontribute to the variability in monthly rent prices? What do youthink?I'm sure you all look for apartments? Right.As college students, that's part of being a student, you have tofind a place to live. Right.So what factors contribute to the variability wesee in monthly rent prices? What have you noticed?Location? Right. Location is definitely a factorthat contributes to that, what elsesize,number of bedrooms,what elseamenities? Right.The age of the building?Right. Very old buildings versus newbuildings,parking? Does they have parking or not, that contributes to thevariability and monthly rent prices.So there's all these factors that contribute to thevariability of monthly rent prices.And my job is to understand that variability of monthly rentprices. But the way I'm going tounderstand it is by selecting one of the many factors becauseof simple regression. So I only have one variable thatI can use. Right?So when we look at this variability of our monthly rentprice is really composed of two things is composed by thevariability that is explained by the variable you'veselectedand the variability that's left unexplained because it's due toother factors. So in our case the variabilityof monthly rent priceis some portion of that is explained by the apartment sizeand some other portion is left unexplained because it's due tolocation amenities, age of the building.Does it have parking or not? So this r square quantity is suchan important measure for us because it has a very niceintuitive idea.It is a quantity between zero and 1#####which implies it is aproportionand it is a proportion of the variability in the response thatis actually explained by the one variable you selected.So if this proportion is closer to one,what does that tell you about the explanatory variable youselected?Is it explaining a lot of that variability.Yeah, there's a very few variability left.Unaccounted for by that explanatory variable.If that correlation coefficient, if that r square value is closerto zero,then that explanatory variable you selected to understand thevariability of that response is not that great,right? It's not accounting for a lot of that variability.It's not explaining a lot of that variability.So let's look at this value where we find it in our outputand how do we interpret it?So where are we gonna find this? R square quantity?It's part of the coefficients outputand right under it are some numerical summaries,some of which are your art score quantities, one is the adjustedR square. We never use this one.The adjusted is used when you have a model that has more thanone explanatory variable because you can think of creating amodel that includes all your explanatory variables.Right? If you had access to that and it would be a very goodmodel. But then you have to adjust theart square because in your square quantity would be oneand that can be. So you need to adjust it.So that's what the adjusted R square is for.So we don't use it because we're using simple regression.So our our square isthe multiple are square. There it is.So what does this#####number tell you? In our example, itsuggests that 67.24of the variation. In my response is actuallyexplained by the relationship it has with the explanatoryvariable.In other words, 67.24% of thevariation in monthly rent price, which iswhat we are trying to understandis explained by the relationship it has withapartment size,67%of the variation we see in these monthly rent prices is actuallydue to the fact that you're looking at different apartmentsizesAbout 67%.The other 32% is left unexplained that other32% is due to location amenities, theage of the building, whether it has a park parking or not, theother 32% is not accounted for with this model.Does that make sense in terms of our art square, such a beautifulnumber and we love it so much because of this intuitive ideathat alludes to how good of a model you have.Is it a good model? Did you pick the right explanatory variable?Well, let's look at this Art square quantity and see whetherwe did select an appropriate explanatory variable of the manywe could have chosengood.Now, if we have the R square quantity, can we compute thecorrelation coefficient? Rwhat do you think?Probably right. Because we're not always gonnahave access to data, especially at an exam setting.Hence we can't just use the core function to compute thiscorrelation coefficient. So we have to use output in onepossibility is to use the r square quantity to compute ourcorrelation coefficient. It is going to be the squareroot of our square.I do want to add to this the plus or minus to remindourselves to#####always checkis it a positive direction or is it a negative direction? Andwe're gonna check using either the sign of the slopeor the direction of the scatter plot or inin our case, what type of direction do we haveslope is positive. We looked at the scatter plotand we said it was a positive direction.So we do have a positive directionpositive correlation coefficient because that positive negativegives you the direction and then square root of r R squarequantity.Always multiple are square. Never adjusted .6724.So we getOur Correlation Coefficient .82.So from the r square quantity we can get the correlationcoefficient,which is what you would do on a homework or an exam where wewant to provide some output. That provides lots of pieces ofinformation rather than the direct output of the correlationfunction. Okay, yes,that's still white.So our square measures. So when do we use our squareversus our both are alluding to the strength of the associationbetween x and y. Are square provides themagnitude provides the strength and it also provides thedirection.That's what the correlation coefficient gives us from forour model,Our square howevergives you that I concept but without the positive and thenegative. But it has a very niceinterpretation because your art square quantity is from 0 to 1and it's a proportion. The closer that proportion is tooneimplies that your explanatory variable is doing a very goodjob at explaining all the variability you see in yourresponse.Which is by definition what we are trying to do withregression.Why are we using regression tolook at the relationship#####between your X and your Y.Hmmdirection,squarestrength.So the R. R correlation are always givesyou a direction which is not what you get from our square.What you get from our square. Is this nice interpretation thatalludes to the original goal of regression which is tounderstand the variability of your response by including amodel that has many explanatory variables.Good.Last things about descriptive regression.Before we move on toinference,nonlinear relationshipsalways visualize your data are will always create a linearmodel for you. Even if the relationship is notlinear. So as step one, you always needto visualize explore your data. You did that with em.Right, you're gonna continue to do that provide the rightgraphical displays to understand your data before you conductyour analysis.Outliers, outliers could influence your regressionline.It could be quite influential. So we don't give you the toolsto understand outliers. Um We simply want you to commenton whether you have outliers or not, potential outliers in yourdata set or not?But they could steer your analysis in one direction oranotherand then the other one is dangers of extrapolating.When we do regression analysis,you can only make predictions within the range of X.If you make predictions outside the range of X, then you don'treally know what the china is going to continue to be.That's different analysis, but not with regression.With regression. It really is only for the rangeof X. Otherwise you're extrapolatingand then you have to do further analysis.Okay, so here's an exampleof extrapolation. What's gonna happen in the21 56 Olympics for sprintersshould be sprint, nice spring.What's gonna happen?We#####have winning timesFor sprinters and then eight and then year not eight year.And they have records for the Olympics.Up to this was up to 1996. They gave you an r squaredquantity for males in our square quantity for females.And what did they decide to do extend the line? So that in theyear 21,which is what they're predicting something great is gonna happen.Finally, women and men are gonna run just as fast.There's not going to be a difference,but why do we stop there? What would be even a better headline?What is it?Huh?With women actually run faster than men? Furthermore, whenwe can do winning time inzero seconds. Right?Furthermore winning a race innegative time. Right? Why stop at the year 2156. Right.So this isan example of extrapolation. You don't extrapolate.You don't know what's gonna happen.You don't have information for that.Okay. There's no need why you need tostop at 21 56. You can even make a betterheadline if you actually continue further into the futurebased on their analysis. Okay.The other one is dangerous of combining groupsinappropriately.So, a school district wanted to understand what the optimalduration of study is for students to achieve satisfactoryresults.So they asked teachers various classes to do a survey amongtheir students and they plotted the results of the survey thatlooked at the preparation hours and then their final percentage.What do you noticenegative direction?Right? Strong relationship.It looks. Okay.Right.What would be a message based on this plotstudy? Lessperform better?Does that make sense?Should I be advertising that to my students study less? You'llperform better.Yes.Quality#####versus quantity. That's what I should be.Advertising quality of study versus quantity of study.So what's going on,what do we thinkthey did ask teachers? Various subjects.So, of course, some subjects require more versus less.Right. So, if you actually look at eachsubject,you see why you see this type of relationship.It doesn't make sense because the data was combinedinappropriately. There's confounding factors herethat don't really highlight what's going on.You should be analyzing this data separately by subject.Okay, so that's what we mean by Simpson's paradox.And then the last thing is even if the correlation is exactlyonewhich is unheard of. But even if you cannot say thatX is causing Y to occurthe different analysis and conversation is very hard toprovide a convincing argument for.Okay.Okay.And that isit for descriptive analysis.Shall we practice it? Going back to our long eyelashes? We havethree questions you get to work through and click in.Think about what we've seen so far.Check. Did I understand these lastitems. Do I know where to look in ouroutput to come up with these ideas? One less thing to worryabout after the break in terms of studying for that exam.If not ask raise your hand,ask away.Try it out.You're here. And that's that time check.Do I know how to answer these questions If it were to appearon homework eight that I consume through the hallmarkor one less thing to study for that exam which is intwo weeks if you don't count. Thanksgivingthere's a clicker for the correlation.Be good to your future selves. There's not much time#####left inthe semesterare you justso what's the correlation between these two quantitativevariables.How are we gonna find this correlation?Have your correlation coefficient? Go ahead and clickin decide which one matches your core correlation coefficientbased on the clickers.So we want the correlation between these two quantitativevariables, which implies we want the correlation coefficient.RIf we don't have the data set in front of us, we can't use thatcore function to compute this correlation coefficient like wewould in lab after the break.So where are we going to get that correlation coefficient? Rlucky for us this our output provides the R square and we'renever going to use the adjusted R squarebecause that implies that we have more than one explanatoryvariable. If we had more than oneexplanatory variable we would be using that adjusted R square butthat's not our case. We have simple regression.One explanatory variable. We go with the multiple aresquareplus or minus square root of our square.Is it going to be positive or negative?The slope will determine the sign based on the slope we havea positive direction. So it's gonna be a positiveassociation. You can look at the slope.You can also look at the scatter plot.6069giving meA correlation coefficient of.779.and only about 60% of us got that.The other common answer was aand a is your R square quantity, which is not the correlationcoefficient.Should I add units to this quantity?No, the correlation coefficient is a unit less quantity.No units.If I were to change all of my data and convert it tomilligrams, I will still get#####the same correlation coefficient of.779. No units.Okay.Ready to try the next one.What is this asking for?This is an interpretation ofare squareSo we can pick up our square from the output.There it is 60.69% of the variationin the response is explained by the relationship thisresponse has with the explanatory variable.My response is whateyelash with lengthand my explanatory variable isthe eye withSo 60.69% of the variations I have inthese responses in these eyelash lengths that I have in my datais actually explained by the fact that we're looking atdifferent umeyes of different sizes.The rest is left unexplained by this factor.Some other thing is explaining the restgood.And finally the last oneclicker.What do we think about this one? Giraffes?The eye with of giraffes um of a giraffe was measured and foundto be 4.08 cm.Should we use this model to predict the eyelash length forgiraffes?Yes or no. Would it be valid? We can alwaysdo it right but is it valid?It's a formula. So we can always plug stuff intothe formula and outcome some sort of predicted value but isthat predicted value meaningful or valid for the analysis?Go ahead and discusswith your neighbors please.And that's the time that you're in herebe good to your future selves. You're here for an hour,understand regression. One less thing that you have toworry about for that exam that's coming up soon.The hardest part was getting here.Now that you're herestay focused for an hour.You already did the hard part which issnowing and you're here.Now let's gain something out of it.Okayso can#####we do thiswhen we make predictions? We should always be makingpredictions withinthe range of our explanatory variable.So if you look at the scatter plot, is this outside the rangeor inside the range of my explanatory variable?It is outside the range. So hence we cannot use thismodel to make predictions for giraffes.So we're not gonna use it because it is outside the rangeof my explanatory variable which is i with this isextrapolating an example of extrapolatinggood.We are done with the descriptive side of regression.Now comesthe inference.The new stuff for a lot of us.So let's pretend for a second that instead of just having asample of observations, I actually had apopulation of observations. The entire population data set.What would my scattered plot look like?I wouldn't just have eight xy combinations.I would have for every single listing in the city.I would have all of those xy combinations.So my scatter plot would have lots and lots and lots and lotsof lots of dots.If I actually had population data, I could fit a linearmodel through that population dataand that linear model would bethe true regression line.The true population regression linewhich only exists ifI had population data, which I don't I always work with sampledatabut that line does exist.What have we done so far with inference? We take our sampleand a statistic and we always want to learn about thepopulation parameter.The same thing applies to regression is just a little bittrickier. But the same idea appliesif we actually had population data we would have aregression model#####for this population data.So this one requires population data.What we have access to thoseis sample data.So my best guess as to what that population model might be is theone I create using my sample. So this one only requiressample data.So it's analogous to having a sample and finding a statisticthat's estimating the population parameter.That is unknown.So this true line is that population idea that does existif you had population data and your best guess is based onsample data, which is that sample version of a regressionline.Now that population data, the population regression line ismade up of Parameters. So beta zero is your true.Why interceptfor the population of interest.We don't have population data. So we always use our statistic,B0 is your statistic which will vary from sample to sample.Because if I had different observations, I'll create adifferent regression line. So this is my sample, yinterceptand it variesfrom sample to samplejust like every statistic.The same thing happens with slope.Beta one is my parameter and that's my populationslope. Which requires population datain order to know its quantity. And the best guess for thatpopulation slope is my sample slope.My statistic.So we still have this idea of parameter versus statistic isjust a little bit different from what we are used tobecausewe have an equation of the line that we're estimating basically.Okay, using the sample.Now when we do inference, where are we gonna go with this?We are going to assess if we have a linear relationshipbetween the X and the Y. The explanatory variable in theresponse.#####If we're assessingLinking it back to homework seven.The last question, if we are assessing a claim,what type of inference method should we usea test of an interval?When you read those options on question nine of homework seven,if you're assessing a claim, what method are you going to beusing a test or an interval?A test? Right. So when we assess if we have alinear relationship, we're going to conducta hypothesis test.We're also going to be providing intervals around our estimates.After all this data. This regression line, Thissample regression line is based on a sample data and if I had adifferent sample, I would have a different sample line.So instead of just providing a predicted quantity, like we'vebeen doing, we're gonna construct intervals around ourpredictions and talk about the different types of intervals wecan have.And then the last thing is assumptions.That's always the last thing you do in regression because youneed the model.So let's start with the first one.Shall wetake a break before we start?Yes,two minute break, stretch. Come back.Focus for the last part. So you have one less thing toreview after thanksgiving.You don't wannaaccumulate things.Okay, shall we start?Yes,So we're gonna conduct a testwhich means we have to have some sort ofMeasure of variability. Okay, so going back toway back, Chapter two, a standard deviation.That standard deviation measured the average distance of anobservation to the mean, a typical observation to the meat.That's what that standard deviation provided for us.It turns out that regression also has its own standarddeviation,but it's not the same#####as what we had before.So that standard deviation is looking at the average size ofthe residual on average. How far away are your observedvalues from the predicted? If you notice all of these lines,horizontal lines are your residualsfrom Tuesday residuals areyour errors.Some of these residualsare quite large, we were way off for some um predictions.Some of them are very small. We were almost there some mighteven be zero right on target. Right? So we want to get a senseof the average size of these residuals, Some are big, someare small. What is the average sizeroughly? How far off is your estimate from that observedquantity?So that's what we're gonna call the standard deviation for theregression. So it is an average size whichmeans it's going to be adding thingsanddividing by a total right? That's how you find average toadd things up and divide by a totalby definition. That's how you do an average,it is the average size of the residual the error term.How do we find each error term? We look at the observation.How far away is that observation fromthe predicted value?Here's your observation and here's your predictedand you're measuring the distance between those two.The residual observed minus predicted.And you're doing that for every observation because you want toget that average size of these residuals.So here's the second one.Why? To how far away it is from its predicted quantity.Let's just go to the last one.The last observation, how far away it is fromit's predicted quantity.Now, if we leave it as is some#####of these errors are positive,some are negative because sometimes we overestimatesometimes we underestimate. So if we were to just computethese errors and add them up, we would getzero things canceled out. What's her quick fix?Square?We've always done that.So let's square everything.And if we're squaringwe need to unscrew air so we need to take the square root ofitand nowthe sample sizeIt is true that to find an average you have to divide by atotal. However our total is not goingto be in, it is going to be N -2.We're losing 2° of freedom.The reason for that is every time we include an estimate intoour measurements we need to compensate for introducing errorby taking away a degree of freedom.Where are we introducing estimates.When we find white hatWe're using B0 which is a statistic.And we're using B1 which is also a statistic.Both B0 and B one are estimating Parameters.They're estimating beta zero and beta one.So because we're estimating two parameters,We're introducing error into our calculation, we compensate bytaking away degrees of freedom. So the reason why it's N -2 isbecause we're estimating two parameters when we use white hatbest wayif we had non simple regression and introduced another one wewould need to compensate and provide the appropriate degreesof freedom there. Okay,so where are we gonna find this quantity because it's not gonnabe fun to do this with the formula, which you do have onyour formula card, which when we asked the students always wantto use the formula but you can use ourthis quantity#####is right here.The residual standard air,this is your s your standard deviation for the regression.The averagesizeof the residual.You're swhat does it mean? What's the interpretation of it?Well, a residual is measuring how far away is the predictedfrom the observe. And we're getting a sense ofwhat is that average size of the residual.So we would estimate that the observe whyIt's about126point62 cents away fromthe predicted why measuring that distance between the observedand the predicted on average? As you did see some of theseresiduals were large, others were small.But on average this is how far your observed quantities arefrom the predictedabout this much away.And this standard erroris what we get to useto findthe the standard error for our statistic.So let's do that, shall weone step closer.Is there a significant relationshipmeaning slope? What happens if if your slope is zero?What happens if your slip is zero?Flat line doesn't matter what X is?It's not related to why it's not helping you explain why?Right. So is there a significantrelationship status quo? There is no relationship, your flat,your line is flatalternative. There is a relationship, you'readding some sort of slope to this line.X. Is helping you make betterpredictions because it is related to your why?So when we are asking assessing about the significantrelationship between the two variables you've selected, wewant to test theories about the slope.H not is going to suggest scatter points.No relationship. It doesn't matter what X.Is why it's not getting any better in terms of thepredictions, because there's no relationship alternative.Here's one possible#####relationship.A positive relationship. It could be negative, right? Itcould be a little weaker, a little bit more strong.But there is a relationshipbecause it's quantitative data. What type of test that we'regoing to use?T test? So, let's compute our test statistic.We're gonna use a T. Test and we're also going toconstruct a confidence interval. C.F zeros in there or not.Shall we do it?It's not too bad. So let's work through it.It is going to be a T. It is going to measure how faraway is our statistic, which is our sample slopefrom the null value, which happens to be zero.Most of the time. Sometimes you might have toadjust it divided bythe standard errorof that slope.I'm not even gonna show you the formula for the standard air.It is on the formula card. It is very convoluted more thanI would like, but it does use that sample standard deviationfor the regression, but I'm not even gonna show it to youbecause you'll see it all comes from our output.Okay,if H that is true, we are going to be using a T.Distribution how many degrees of freedom?Simple Regression and -2.We're estimating two things. We have to adjust the degrees offreedom accordinglyAnd -1 were always only estimating sigma.So that's why it was only one. But now we're estimating twothings.So let's conduct our test.Here we go.Is there a significant relationshipbetween our x apartment size and rymonthly rent price for this population of listings in thecity. In other words, status quo isgonna suggestNo relationship, beta one equal zero.There#####is no relationship between these two variables in thispopulationalternative is gonna suggestthere is a relationship, so it should be not equal to zero.So beta one representsthe population slopebetween apartment sizeand monthly rent priceforthe populationof listingsin this particular city, whatever city it is.And this is where you want to pay attention for the next threeminutes because it will save you a headache later on.So now that we have our h not an Rh a let's go ahead and performthe test,right, So let's perform the testt how far away is the one from the null value, which in ourcase is zero and we're gonna divide that by the standarderror of our statistic.We are testing theories aboutthe slope.Hence when we look at the our output,we're going to focus onthe slope.Okaywe're testing theories about the slope.Let's focus there.So b. One is your sample slope.So there's my sample slope. There's B 1.8303.How far away it is from zero.And I'm gonna measure this with the right standard air which isright here.There's my standard air. That's why I didn't show you theformula. But it is in the formula card.If you're curious about how it was computed.So it's .2366.Furthermore. What do you see in the nextcolumn?The T. Value3.509. There's your t.value right there.T. Test statistic valuefurthermore. What do you see in the nextcolor?Very weird labeling. We haven't seen that before butit does a probability greater than absolute value of T.What do you think that meansthe p value?Right? So this last column hereis your p valuebut it is greater#####than the absolute value of your teststatistic. Which implies it isa two sided P valley. Always always two sided.Can never go around that. Always two sided.So with that let's evaluate the p value and clickinevaluatewhat do we do when we evaluate a P value,we quantify the evidence against the null.That's it. That's all we do when weevaluate.So there's my P value. How much evidence do I haveagainst the north?Everything comes from our output.We don't even have to use shiny app anymore.All right. It's all there everything islisted as long as you know where to look.If you don't know where to look, you're gonna go straight to theformula card and you're gonna get all these formulas and thenyou're gonna spend a lot of time trying to put those piecestogether when it's all just in the art output.Okay. Sothat something will practice in the next lab.So how much evidence evaluate when we evaluate? The only thingwe want is for you to quantify the evidence against the null.So how much evidence do we havestrong evidence?P value isBetween 5% and1%. So we have strong evidence.Good. That's it.That's all we want. When they evaluatewhat's the secondidea that gets lumped in to evaluate,write a conclusionright. We started with the claimlooking at whether there is a relationship between X and Y andthis population.What are we gonna suggestbased on the data?It seems like we do have a relationship between X and Y.In this populationbased on the data? We have evidence to support this ideanotice that I don't say#####based on the data.Yes.There is a relationship but I or I don't say there is arelationship.It's always very ambiguous right? Based on the data.This is what I can suggest.I might be wrong but this is what I will suggest based on thedatabecause I was readingdrafts yesterday and I keptreading very strong statements yes.Even though your P value is very very very very very tiny.We're still not proving H A is trueright based on the data. This is what I'm suggesting.Okay,so be careful with your wording. Even if your P value is veryvery very very small.So there's my conclusion.If I were to construct a confidence interval for myslope,Do you think this interval is going to contain zeroclick indiscuss with your neighborthink about what we've done in the past in terms of intervalsand testing in the connection between these two.What do we think?Will this interval contain the value of zeroclickinglink everything together that we've done put it all togetherbefore we construct the interval.And that would be the last thing we do.Let's construct an intervallots of us are saying no,we are supporting that alternative.And the alternative is suggesting that there is arelationship meaning that slope is something else other thanzero. So when we construct thisinterval to estimate the slope, that interval probably doesn'thave zero. Let's confirm.Shall welet's construct an interval.What is always in the middle of the intervalyour point estimate your statistic.So right in the middle of this interval is my point estimateof my population slope.My statistic.My sample slopeto that I'm gonna add#####and subtracta margin of error which is half the width of the interval.And that margin of error is composed of two things.The standard air and a T. Star.The T. Star is always going to comefrom the T. Table.At least the tools I've given you is always from the table andwe're gonna use and minus two degrees of freedom.Ready to construct the interval.That's the last thing we'll doand thenstart our breakafter we do the period.So let's construct this interval.B one plus or minus T. StarStandard error of B one.The most common error.T star T value. Are these the same thing?No. So my T.Star will always come from the table.So find for me the T. Star quantity.How many degrees of freedomfor regression? Always simple regression, simple regression,which is us always and minus two.We have eight listings so our degrees of freedomsixsample sizes eight. So let's put it all together,find for me that T. Star quantity.And remember the standard error is right here.There's a standard errorofmy slope.So .2366.What did y'all get for that? T star2.44seven.So right in the middle is my statistic to that I'm adding andsubtracting a margin of errorof.57896 which gives me an intervalthat hopefully does not contain zero and it doesn'tfor every increase inapartment size, we expect to see an increase in monthly rentprice that ranges between 0.25, 25 cents and a dollar and41 cents.RightBased on this 95% confidence interval.Good.And one last thing,last last. Let's see how we do.We've been working with intervals for a while.This is the last time#####we're going to interpret aninterpretation of the level last timeculmination.Do we think the following statement is correct? Whathappens if we construct many many manyintervals?Is this correct?Is the last time.So really think about it.Read it carefully.This is like a check. Yes, I understand confidencelevels. We've been doing it for so long.I finally nailed it. I got it.Or I need to review that. Very important concept.What do we thinkthe level that idea of constructing manymany intervals.What happens to these manymany intervals?one last self assessment.What do we think?And I know it's just random guessing because it truly is 5149.It doesn't get any more random than that.Sodiscuss with your neighbors.What do we think? It is?It's kind of like your seal of approval.Yes. you're done.You've understood level. Focus on something else now oryou need to review the last few chapters where we've beentalking about level constantly.So what do we think?Look at thisand I'll show youthe results. So you see, I'm not lying.It doesn't get more random than that.Right?Is this enough evidence that there's random selection?Defin. I couldn't plan it any better.5050 between these two.So I'll give you one more chance.Try it out again.The one show the resultsdiscuss. Think about itlast time you'll see a level of interpretationIn generic terms. What happens if you have manyintervals approximately what 95% of the intervals.Do whatWhat do these, 95% of the intervals do?I'm curious to see the resultsso I'm gonna stop it and I will see it.How do we explain this?The end of the semesterWe've seen levels so many#####times. I can pull up homer 567.There's a level in every single one of these homeworksevery single one of them.Right? So there's something going on here.Is this right?No, this is not correct. You can always always alwayswrite an interpretation of the level before you even look atyour data before you even construct an interval because itdoes not allude to the one interval you have.It talks about the many intervals and how the manyintervals containyour population parameter. The many many intervals aregoing to contain that population parameter.So we don't include that.The reason why this method is reliable is because if we havemany intervals a high percentage of these intervals contain theparameter. That's whyI don't have to look at the data.I don't have to look at that interval to write theinterpretation at the level. The last time we see it, pleasereview before that exam because it's one of those keyinterpretations that we should understand.Okayand we'll stop here.Have a wonderful break. Please take some time todecompress.Be ready to review your interpretation of the levelbefore exam two.Uh huh.
Hello.It's thursday almost break almost.We have a homework due tonight at 11 59.Make sure you get it in. Uh We have some office hourstoday in person and remote. We have one hour of remotehours. Um Stop by.We're here to help. UmThis assignmentcovers a lot you know a lot of what we've been doing in thepast few weeks. So it's a good indication ofwhat you might want to focus on reviewing versus stuff thatyou've completely understoodAnd you can focus on something else.Um your drafts were due last night if you did not get it inand there is a good chunk of you who did not turn them in lastnight. You do have until today at noon.Well 1230 to get those um drafts in through canvas with aone point deduction after that you will not be getting creditfor the draft.Um If you don't turn in your draft through canvas it will notbe part of the peer review process.You will not get any feedback from your peers.The peer reviews are going to open at 12 45andyou can get those done before you take off for your break.Okay technically they're due next week on Tuesday but I wouldencourage you all to get them done before you start yourbreak. That way you can completely takea pause from stats to 50 for a week because there really isnothing to do next week. If you complete the peer reviewsbefore you take off for a break. Okay get those done,invest an hour, get them done and then that's#####it you're done.Don't procrastinate. Be good to your future selves.Okay? And I also encourage you that while you're here, you'realso good to your future selves. You're investing an hour and ahalf. Work through the ideas thatwe're working through in lecture.Hence you don't have to reinvest this time later on after thebreak because you're doing it now.Okay. Otherwise it's double timeand that's one thing that we often lack time.Okay so make sure that you're here invested.Work through the problems with me, understand ask questionsabout regression focused. I know it's hard in these daysto stay focused, butt focused, get something out of it.You're here for an hour and a half.Don't invest this time yet again afterthe lecture. Okay, highly highly recommendthatumnext week we have no labs, no lectures, no office hours otherthan m right fellows have a few office hours on Tuesday toanswer any peer review questions you might have.But other than that nothing. No new homework opens tonight.We truly want you to take a break,decompressed for a week before you come back and wrap up thesemester and do a strong finish. Okay,Shall we go through regression.So a few things we need to wrap up, we won't get through it alltoday. But that's okay.So regression is looking at the relationship between twoquantitative variables. we have to have two quantitativevariablesand their order for us to get a visual, which is always thefirst step in data analysis, understand your data, visualizethe data, explore the data in order for us to get a visual ofthis#####relationship between these two variables.We're going to use a scatter plot.And as you've noticed by now we are almost at the end of thesemester. Every time we have a graphicaldisplay, we have to include some sort of commentary about what wesee in the graphical display. You did that with? Em right.You have your side by side box plot in your draft.You needed to provide something for the readers.What is it that they should focus on in that plot.You did the same thing with the hissed a gram of thedifferences. Right.What was so meaningful about that, hissed a gram.What are positive differences? What are negative differences?Why are you looking at differences Because of thedependent scenario?So the same thing goes with the scatter plot.When we have our scatter plot, we're going to be conveying theidea of a form? What type of relationship in terms of itsform do we see between these two variables? What is thedirection? What is the strength? And are there any outliers thatyou think? Might there be any outliers? So always use thatvague language because we don't give you the tools to decidewhether something is an outlier or not.We want to hear your perspective of that.Okay,now, when it comes to the strength for your description itis subjective, What is it that you consider strong versus weakversus moderately strong or moderately weak.But then there's also a summary that quantifies that strengthand that's your correlation coefficient.The magnitude of that correlation coefficientis the strength of the association.The closer that magnitude is to#####one,the stronger the association, the closer than magnitude is tozero the weaker the association. That correlation coefficientalso provides a positive in the negative direction of theassociationand then everything we do as you'll see today will have thisvery long formulasthat students will gravitate and want to use however our providesall these key components if you know where to look.So regression is one of those um topics that really relies onnavigating and knowing your way around our output becauseeverything is there, as long as you know where to look as you'llsee today. Okay, so from this regressionoutput we can pick up the linear relationship, themodel, the equation of the line, here's my y interceptand that also provides the slope for mefrom the output.You can get this equation of the line, we went through how tocalculate that equation of the line with formulas but you canjust pick it up from here. Okay,sounds good,what else are we going to do?We're going to dive deep into this correlation coefficient.Rbecause it provides this very nice idea for us.So with regression there's a lot of things you can do.The first four things is what we called descriptive regression.And we'll wrap that up today. The last three things is theinference part of regression, and we'll work through one ofthose. One of the three ideas.There? Only one. Okay, are we readyour square? Let's think about this measure.So we want to pay attention for like two minutes so that weunderstand this r. Square valuebecause this is such a key value,#####Such a key component andwe love it so much because it has a very nice intuitiveinterpretation. Okay,so fact is monthly rent prices are different,right? Even if you were to look at the same apartment size,you will get variability in monthly rent prices.Not every single apartment has the same price.We want to understand the variability of our response,which is monthly rent prices.If I only had eight listings and Ionly had information about eight monthly rent prices.These prices are going to vary. I'm not gonna get the same rentprice, gonna be variability there.If I wanted to predictthe monthly rent price for someone who's interested inrenting an apartment, what would be my best guess based on thefact that I only have access to eight listings in their monthlyrent price.What would you suggest as the best guessif you have quantitative data,only eight observations and you want to make a prediction usingthese eight observations that only include monthly rentprices, what would you predict?What would be a good educated guess?No waythe average, right. If all I had was access to eightobservations and I want to make a prediction using these eightquantitative observations, my best guess is going to be theaverageand I would make the same prediction for everyone.Just the average.The whole point of regression, though, is to understand whatcontributes to this variability in your response.And if I only have access to my response, I'm going to be makingthe same prediction all the time,but we know that prices of apartments, rent, prices varyand that variability is due#####to many factors, some of it isapartment size. What are other factors thatcontribute to the variability in monthly rent prices? What do youthink?I'm sure you all look for apartments? Right.As college students, that's part of being a student, you have tofind a place to live. Right.So what factors contribute to the variability wesee in monthly rent prices? What have you noticed?Location? Right. Location is definitely a factorthat contributes to that, what elsesize,number of bedrooms,what elseamenities? Right.The age of the building?Right. Very old buildings versus newbuildings,parking? Does they have parking or not, that contributes to thevariability and monthly rent prices.So there's all these factors that contribute to thevariability of monthly rent prices.And my job is to understand that variability of monthly rentprices. But the way I'm going tounderstand it is by selecting one of the many factors becauseof simple regression. So I only have one variable thatI can use. Right?So when we look at this variability of our monthly rentprice is really composed of two things is composed by thevariability that is explained by the variable you'veselectedand the variability that's left unexplained because it's due toother factors. So in our case the variabilityof monthly rent priceis some portion of that is explained by the apartment sizeand some other portion is left unexplained because it's due tolocation amenities, age of the building.Does it have parking or not? So this r square quantity is suchan important measure for us because it has a very niceintuitive idea.It is a quantity between zero and 1#####which implies it is aproportionand it is a proportion of the variability in the response thatis actually explained by the one variable you selected.So if this proportion is closer to one,what does that tell you about the explanatory variable youselected?Is it explaining a lot of that variability.Yeah, there's a very few variability left.Unaccounted for by that explanatory variable.If that correlation coefficient, if that r square value is closerto zero,then that explanatory variable you selected to understand thevariability of that response is not that great,right? It's not accounting for a lot of that variability.It's not explaining a lot of that variability.So let's look at this value where we find it in our outputand how do we interpret it?So where are we gonna find this? R square quantity?It's part of the coefficients outputand right under it are some numerical summaries,some of which are your art score quantities, one is the adjustedR square. We never use this one.The adjusted is used when you have a model that has more thanone explanatory variable because you can think of creating amodel that includes all your explanatory variables.Right? If you had access to that and it would be a very goodmodel. But then you have to adjust theart square because in your square quantity would be oneand that can be. So you need to adjust it.So that's what the adjusted R square is for.So we don't use it because we're using simple regression.So our our square isthe multiple are square. There it is.So what does this#####number tell you? In our example, itsuggests that 67.24of the variation. In my response is actuallyexplained by the relationship it has with the explanatoryvariable.In other words, 67.24% of thevariation in monthly rent price, which iswhat we are trying to understandis explained by the relationship it has withapartment size,67%of the variation we see in these monthly rent prices is actuallydue to the fact that you're looking at different apartmentsizesAbout 67%.The other 32% is left unexplained that other32% is due to location amenities, theage of the building, whether it has a park parking or not, theother 32% is not accounted for with this model.Does that make sense in terms of our art square, such a beautifulnumber and we love it so much because of this intuitive ideathat alludes to how good of a model you have.Is it a good model? Did you pick the right explanatory variable?Well, let's look at this Art square quantity and see whetherwe did select an appropriate explanatory variable of the manywe could have chosengood.Now, if we have the R square quantity, can we compute thecorrelation coefficient? Rwhat do you think?Probably right. Because we're not always gonnahave access to data, especially at an exam setting.Hence we can't just use the core function to compute thiscorrelation coefficient. So we have to use output in onepossibility is to use the r square quantity to compute ourcorrelation coefficient. It is going to be the squareroot of our square.I do want to add to this the plus or minus to remindourselves to#####always checkis it a positive direction or is it a negative direction? Andwe're gonna check using either the sign of the slopeor the direction of the scatter plot or inin our case, what type of direction do we haveslope is positive. We looked at the scatter plotand we said it was a positive direction.So we do have a positive directionpositive correlation coefficient because that positive negativegives you the direction and then square root of r R squarequantity.Always multiple are square. Never adjusted .6724.So we getOur Correlation Coefficient .82.So from the r square quantity we can get the correlationcoefficient,which is what you would do on a homework or an exam where wewant to provide some output. That provides lots of pieces ofinformation rather than the direct output of the correlationfunction. Okay, yes,that's still white.So our square measures. So when do we use our squareversus our both are alluding to the strength of the associationbetween x and y. Are square provides themagnitude provides the strength and it also provides thedirection.That's what the correlation coefficient gives us from forour model,Our square howevergives you that I concept but without the positive and thenegative. But it has a very niceinterpretation because your art square quantity is from 0 to 1and it's a proportion. The closer that proportion is tooneimplies that your explanatory variable is doing a very goodjob at explaining all the variability you see in yourresponse.Which is by definition what we are trying to do withregression.Why are we using regression tolook at the relationship#####between your X and your Y.Hmmdirection,squarestrength.So the R. R correlation are always givesyou a direction which is not what you get from our square.What you get from our square. Is this nice interpretation thatalludes to the original goal of regression which is tounderstand the variability of your response by including amodel that has many explanatory variables.Good.Last things about descriptive regression.Before we move on toinference,nonlinear relationshipsalways visualize your data are will always create a linearmodel for you. Even if the relationship is notlinear. So as step one, you always needto visualize explore your data. You did that with em.Right, you're gonna continue to do that provide the rightgraphical displays to understand your data before you conductyour analysis.Outliers, outliers could influence your regressionline.It could be quite influential. So we don't give you the toolsto understand outliers. Um We simply want you to commenton whether you have outliers or not, potential outliers in yourdata set or not?But they could steer your analysis in one direction oranotherand then the other one is dangers of extrapolating.When we do regression analysis,you can only make predictions within the range of X.If you make predictions outside the range of X, then you don'treally know what the china is going to continue to be.That's different analysis, but not with regression.With regression. It really is only for the rangeof X. Otherwise you're extrapolatingand then you have to do further analysis.Okay, so here's an exampleof extrapolation. What's gonna happen in the21 56 Olympics for sprintersshould be sprint, nice spring.What's gonna happen?We#####have winning timesFor sprinters and then eight and then year not eight year.And they have records for the Olympics.Up to this was up to 1996. They gave you an r squaredquantity for males in our square quantity for females.And what did they decide to do extend the line? So that in theyear 21,which is what they're predicting something great is gonna happen.Finally, women and men are gonna run just as fast.There's not going to be a difference,but why do we stop there? What would be even a better headline?What is it?Huh?With women actually run faster than men? Furthermore, whenwe can do winning time inzero seconds. Right?Furthermore winning a race innegative time. Right? Why stop at the year 2156. Right.So this isan example of extrapolation. You don't extrapolate.You don't know what's gonna happen.You don't have information for that.Okay. There's no need why you need tostop at 21 56. You can even make a betterheadline if you actually continue further into the futurebased on their analysis. Okay.The other one is dangerous of combining groupsinappropriately.So, a school district wanted to understand what the optimalduration of study is for students to achieve satisfactoryresults.So they asked teachers various classes to do a survey amongtheir students and they plotted the results of the survey thatlooked at the preparation hours and then their final percentage.What do you noticenegative direction?Right? Strong relationship.It looks. Okay.Right.What would be a message based on this plotstudy? Lessperform better?Does that make sense?Should I be advertising that to my students study less? You'llperform better.Yes.Quality#####versus quantity. That's what I should be.Advertising quality of study versus quantity of study.So what's going on,what do we thinkthey did ask teachers? Various subjects.So, of course, some subjects require more versus less.Right. So, if you actually look at eachsubject,you see why you see this type of relationship.It doesn't make sense because the data was combinedinappropriately. There's confounding factors herethat don't really highlight what's going on.You should be analyzing this data separately by subject.Okay, so that's what we mean by Simpson's paradox.And then the last thing is even if the correlation is exactlyonewhich is unheard of. But even if you cannot say thatX is causing Y to occurthe different analysis and conversation is very hard toprovide a convincing argument for.Okay.Okay.And that isit for descriptive analysis.Shall we practice it? Going back to our long eyelashes? We havethree questions you get to work through and click in.Think about what we've seen so far.Check. Did I understand these lastitems. Do I know where to look in ouroutput to come up with these ideas? One less thing to worryabout after the break in terms of studying for that exam.If not ask raise your hand,ask away.Try it out.You're here. And that's that time check.Do I know how to answer these questions If it were to appearon homework eight that I consume through the hallmarkor one less thing to study for that exam which is intwo weeks if you don't count. Thanksgivingthere's a clicker for the correlation.Be good to your future selves. There's not much time#####left inthe semesterare you justso what's the correlation between these two quantitativevariables.How are we gonna find this correlation?Have your correlation coefficient? Go ahead and clickin decide which one matches your core correlation coefficientbased on the clickers.So we want the correlation between these two quantitativevariables, which implies we want the correlation coefficient.RIf we don't have the data set in front of us, we can't use thatcore function to compute this correlation coefficient like wewould in lab after the break.So where are we going to get that correlation coefficient? Rlucky for us this our output provides the R square and we'renever going to use the adjusted R squarebecause that implies that we have more than one explanatoryvariable. If we had more than oneexplanatory variable we would be using that adjusted R square butthat's not our case. We have simple regression.One explanatory variable. We go with the multiple aresquareplus or minus square root of our square.Is it going to be positive or negative?The slope will determine the sign based on the slope we havea positive direction. So it's gonna be a positiveassociation. You can look at the slope.You can also look at the scatter plot.6069giving meA correlation coefficient of.779.and only about 60% of us got that.The other common answer was aand a is your R square quantity, which is not the correlationcoefficient.Should I add units to this quantity?No, the correlation coefficient is a unit less quantity.No units.If I were to change all of my data and convert it tomilligrams, I will still get#####the same correlation coefficient of.779. No units.Okay.Ready to try the next one.What is this asking for?This is an interpretation ofare squareSo we can pick up our square from the output.There it is 60.69% of the variationin the response is explained by the relationship thisresponse has with the explanatory variable.My response is whateyelash with lengthand my explanatory variable isthe eye withSo 60.69% of the variations I have inthese responses in these eyelash lengths that I have in my datais actually explained by the fact that we're looking atdifferent umeyes of different sizes.The rest is left unexplained by this factor.Some other thing is explaining the restgood.And finally the last oneclicker.What do we think about this one? Giraffes?The eye with of giraffes um of a giraffe was measured and foundto be 4.08 cm.Should we use this model to predict the eyelash length forgiraffes?Yes or no. Would it be valid? We can alwaysdo it right but is it valid?It's a formula. So we can always plug stuff intothe formula and outcome some sort of predicted value but isthat predicted value meaningful or valid for the analysis?Go ahead and discusswith your neighbors please.And that's the time that you're in herebe good to your future selves. You're here for an hour,understand regression. One less thing that you have toworry about for that exam that's coming up soon.The hardest part was getting here.Now that you're herestay focused for an hour.You already did the hard part which issnowing and you're here.Now let's gain something out of it.Okayso can#####we do thiswhen we make predictions? We should always be makingpredictions withinthe range of our explanatory variable.So if you look at the scatter plot, is this outside the rangeor inside the range of my explanatory variable?It is outside the range. So hence we cannot use thismodel to make predictions for giraffes.So we're not gonna use it because it is outside the rangeof my explanatory variable which is i with this isextrapolating an example of extrapolatinggood.We are done with the descriptive side of regression.Now comesthe inference.The new stuff for a lot of us.So let's pretend for a second that instead of just having asample of observations, I actually had apopulation of observations. The entire population data set.What would my scattered plot look like?I wouldn't just have eight xy combinations.I would have for every single listing in the city.I would have all of those xy combinations.So my scatter plot would have lots and lots and lots and lotsof lots of dots.If I actually had population data, I could fit a linearmodel through that population dataand that linear model would bethe true regression line.The true population regression linewhich only exists ifI had population data, which I don't I always work with sampledatabut that line does exist.What have we done so far with inference? We take our sampleand a statistic and we always want to learn about thepopulation parameter.The same thing applies to regression is just a little bittrickier. But the same idea appliesif we actually had population data we would have aregression model#####for this population data.So this one requires population data.What we have access to thoseis sample data.So my best guess as to what that population model might be is theone I create using my sample. So this one only requiressample data.So it's analogous to having a sample and finding a statisticthat's estimating the population parameter.That is unknown.So this true line is that population idea that does existif you had population data and your best guess is based onsample data, which is that sample version of a regressionline.Now that population data, the population regression line ismade up of Parameters. So beta zero is your true.Why interceptfor the population of interest.We don't have population data. So we always use our statistic,B0 is your statistic which will vary from sample to sample.Because if I had different observations, I'll create adifferent regression line. So this is my sample, yinterceptand it variesfrom sample to samplejust like every statistic.The same thing happens with slope.Beta one is my parameter and that's my populationslope. Which requires population datain order to know its quantity. And the best guess for thatpopulation slope is my sample slope.My statistic.So we still have this idea of parameter versus statistic isjust a little bit different from what we are used tobecausewe have an equation of the line that we're estimating basically.Okay, using the sample.Now when we do inference, where are we gonna go with this?We are going to assess if we have a linear relationshipbetween the X and the Y. The explanatory variable in theresponse.#####If we're assessingLinking it back to homework seven.The last question, if we are assessing a claim,what type of inference method should we usea test of an interval?When you read those options on question nine of homework seven,if you're assessing a claim, what method are you going to beusing a test or an interval?A test? Right. So when we assess if we have alinear relationship, we're going to conducta hypothesis test.We're also going to be providing intervals around our estimates.After all this data. This regression line, Thissample regression line is based on a sample data and if I had adifferent sample, I would have a different sample line.So instead of just providing a predicted quantity, like we'vebeen doing, we're gonna construct intervals around ourpredictions and talk about the different types of intervals wecan have.And then the last thing is assumptions.That's always the last thing you do in regression because youneed the model.So let's start with the first one.Shall wetake a break before we start?Yes,two minute break, stretch. Come back.Focus for the last part. So you have one less thing toreview after thanksgiving.You don't wannaaccumulate things.Okay, shall we start?Yes,So we're gonna conduct a testwhich means we have to have some sort ofMeasure of variability. Okay, so going back toway back, Chapter two, a standard deviation.That standard deviation measured the average distance of anobservation to the mean, a typical observation to the meat.That's what that standard deviation provided for us.It turns out that regression also has its own standarddeviation,but it's not the same#####as what we had before.So that standard deviation is looking at the average size ofthe residual on average. How far away are your observedvalues from the predicted? If you notice all of these lines,horizontal lines are your residualsfrom Tuesday residuals areyour errors.Some of these residualsare quite large, we were way off for some um predictions.Some of them are very small. We were almost there some mighteven be zero right on target. Right? So we want to get a senseof the average size of these residuals, Some are big, someare small. What is the average sizeroughly? How far off is your estimate from that observedquantity?So that's what we're gonna call the standard deviation for theregression. So it is an average size whichmeans it's going to be adding thingsanddividing by a total right? That's how you find average toadd things up and divide by a totalby definition. That's how you do an average,it is the average size of the residual the error term.How do we find each error term? We look at the observation.How far away is that observation fromthe predicted value?Here's your observation and here's your predictedand you're measuring the distance between those two.The residual observed minus predicted.And you're doing that for every observation because you want toget that average size of these residuals.So here's the second one.Why? To how far away it is from its predicted quantity.Let's just go to the last one.The last observation, how far away it is fromit's predicted quantity.Now, if we leave it as is some#####of these errors are positive,some are negative because sometimes we overestimatesometimes we underestimate. So if we were to just computethese errors and add them up, we would getzero things canceled out. What's her quick fix?Square?We've always done that.So let's square everything.And if we're squaringwe need to unscrew air so we need to take the square root ofitand nowthe sample sizeIt is true that to find an average you have to divide by atotal. However our total is not goingto be in, it is going to be N -2.We're losing 2° of freedom.The reason for that is every time we include an estimate intoour measurements we need to compensate for introducing errorby taking away a degree of freedom.Where are we introducing estimates.When we find white hatWe're using B0 which is a statistic.And we're using B1 which is also a statistic.Both B0 and B one are estimating Parameters.They're estimating beta zero and beta one.So because we're estimating two parameters,We're introducing error into our calculation, we compensate bytaking away degrees of freedom. So the reason why it's N -2 isbecause we're estimating two parameters when we use white hatbest wayif we had non simple regression and introduced another one wewould need to compensate and provide the appropriate degreesof freedom there. Okay,so where are we gonna find this quantity because it's not gonnabe fun to do this with the formula, which you do have onyour formula card, which when we asked the students always wantto use the formula but you can use ourthis quantity#####is right here.The residual standard air,this is your s your standard deviation for the regression.The averagesizeof the residual.You're swhat does it mean? What's the interpretation of it?Well, a residual is measuring how far away is the predictedfrom the observe. And we're getting a sense ofwhat is that average size of the residual.So we would estimate that the observe whyIt's about126point62 cents away fromthe predicted why measuring that distance between the observedand the predicted on average? As you did see some of theseresiduals were large, others were small.But on average this is how far your observed quantities arefrom the predictedabout this much away.And this standard erroris what we get to useto findthe the standard error for our statistic.So let's do that, shall weone step closer.Is there a significant relationshipmeaning slope? What happens if if your slope is zero?What happens if your slip is zero?Flat line doesn't matter what X is?It's not related to why it's not helping you explain why?Right. So is there a significantrelationship status quo? There is no relationship, your flat,your line is flatalternative. There is a relationship, you'readding some sort of slope to this line.X. Is helping you make betterpredictions because it is related to your why?So when we are asking assessing about the significantrelationship between the two variables you've selected, wewant to test theories about the slope.H not is going to suggest scatter points.No relationship. It doesn't matter what X.Is why it's not getting any better in terms of thepredictions, because there's no relationship alternative.Here's one possible#####relationship.A positive relationship. It could be negative, right? Itcould be a little weaker, a little bit more strong.But there is a relationshipbecause it's quantitative data. What type of test that we'regoing to use?T test? So, let's compute our test statistic.We're gonna use a T. Test and we're also going toconstruct a confidence interval. C.F zeros in there or not.Shall we do it?It's not too bad. So let's work through it.It is going to be a T. It is going to measure how faraway is our statistic, which is our sample slopefrom the null value, which happens to be zero.Most of the time. Sometimes you might have toadjust it divided bythe standard errorof that slope.I'm not even gonna show you the formula for the standard air.It is on the formula card. It is very convoluted more thanI would like, but it does use that sample standard deviationfor the regression, but I'm not even gonna show it to youbecause you'll see it all comes from our output.Okay,if H that is true, we are going to be using a T.Distribution how many degrees of freedom?Simple Regression and -2.We're estimating two things. We have to adjust the degrees offreedom accordinglyAnd -1 were always only estimating sigma.So that's why it was only one. But now we're estimating twothings.So let's conduct our test.Here we go.Is there a significant relationshipbetween our x apartment size and rymonthly rent price for this population of listings in thecity. In other words, status quo isgonna suggestNo relationship, beta one equal zero.There#####is no relationship between these two variables in thispopulationalternative is gonna suggestthere is a relationship, so it should be not equal to zero.So beta one representsthe population slopebetween apartment sizeand monthly rent priceforthe populationof listingsin this particular city, whatever city it is.And this is where you want to pay attention for the next threeminutes because it will save you a headache later on.So now that we have our h not an Rh a let's go ahead and performthe test,right, So let's perform the testt how far away is the one from the null value, which in ourcase is zero and we're gonna divide that by the standarderror of our statistic.We are testing theories aboutthe slope.Hence when we look at the our output,we're going to focus onthe slope.Okaywe're testing theories about the slope.Let's focus there.So b. One is your sample slope.So there's my sample slope. There's B 1.8303.How far away it is from zero.And I'm gonna measure this with the right standard air which isright here.There's my standard air. That's why I didn't show you theformula. But it is in the formula card.If you're curious about how it was computed.So it's .2366.Furthermore. What do you see in the nextcolumn?The T. Value3.509. There's your t.value right there.T. Test statistic valuefurthermore. What do you see in the nextcolor?Very weird labeling. We haven't seen that before butit does a probability greater than absolute value of T.What do you think that meansthe p value?Right? So this last column hereis your p valuebut it is greater#####than the absolute value of your teststatistic. Which implies it isa two sided P valley. Always always two sided.Can never go around that. Always two sided.So with that let's evaluate the p value and clickinevaluatewhat do we do when we evaluate a P value,we quantify the evidence against the null.That's it. That's all we do when weevaluate.So there's my P value. How much evidence do I haveagainst the north?Everything comes from our output.We don't even have to use shiny app anymore.All right. It's all there everything islisted as long as you know where to look.If you don't know where to look, you're gonna go straight to theformula card and you're gonna get all these formulas and thenyou're gonna spend a lot of time trying to put those piecestogether when it's all just in the art output.Okay. Sothat something will practice in the next lab.So how much evidence evaluate when we evaluate? The only thingwe want is for you to quantify the evidence against the null.So how much evidence do we havestrong evidence?P value isBetween 5% and1%. So we have strong evidence.Good. That's it.That's all we want. When they evaluatewhat's the secondidea that gets lumped in to evaluate,write a conclusionright. We started with the claimlooking at whether there is a relationship between X and Y andthis population.What are we gonna suggestbased on the data?It seems like we do have a relationship between X and Y.In this populationbased on the data? We have evidence to support this ideanotice that I don't say#####based on the data.Yes.There is a relationship but I or I don't say there is arelationship.It's always very ambiguous right? Based on the data.This is what I can suggest.I might be wrong but this is what I will suggest based on thedatabecause I was readingdrafts yesterday and I keptreading very strong statements yes.Even though your P value is very very very very very tiny.We're still not proving H A is trueright based on the data. This is what I'm suggesting.Okay,so be careful with your wording. Even if your P value is veryvery very very small.So there's my conclusion.If I were to construct a confidence interval for myslope,Do you think this interval is going to contain zeroclick indiscuss with your neighborthink about what we've done in the past in terms of intervalsand testing in the connection between these two.What do we think?Will this interval contain the value of zeroclickinglink everything together that we've done put it all togetherbefore we construct the interval.And that would be the last thing we do.Let's construct an intervallots of us are saying no,we are supporting that alternative.And the alternative is suggesting that there is arelationship meaning that slope is something else other thanzero. So when we construct thisinterval to estimate the slope, that interval probably doesn'thave zero. Let's confirm.Shall welet's construct an interval.What is always in the middle of the intervalyour point estimate your statistic.So right in the middle of this interval is my point estimateof my population slope.My statistic.My sample slopeto that I'm gonna add#####and subtracta margin of error which is half the width of the interval.And that margin of error is composed of two things.The standard air and a T. Star.The T. Star is always going to comefrom the T. Table.At least the tools I've given you is always from the table andwe're gonna use and minus two degrees of freedom.Ready to construct the interval.That's the last thing we'll doand thenstart our breakafter we do the period.So let's construct this interval.B one plus or minus T. StarStandard error of B one.The most common error.T star T value. Are these the same thing?No. So my T.Star will always come from the table.So find for me the T. Star quantity.How many degrees of freedomfor regression? Always simple regression, simple regression,which is us always and minus two.We have eight listings so our degrees of freedomsixsample sizes eight. So let's put it all together,find for me that T. Star quantity.And remember the standard error is right here.There's a standard errorofmy slope.So .2366.What did y'all get for that? T star2.44seven.So right in the middle is my statistic to that I'm adding andsubtracting a margin of errorof.57896 which gives me an intervalthat hopefully does not contain zero and it doesn'tfor every increase inapartment size, we expect to see an increase in monthly rentprice that ranges between 0.25, 25 cents and a dollar and41 cents.RightBased on this 95% confidence interval.Good.And one last thing,last last. Let's see how we do.We've been working with intervals for a while.This is the last time#####we're going to interpret aninterpretation of the level last timeculmination.Do we think the following statement is correct? Whathappens if we construct many many manyintervals?Is this correct?Is the last time.So really think about it.Read it carefully.This is like a check. Yes, I understand confidencelevels. We've been doing it for so long.I finally nailed it. I got it.Or I need to review that. Very important concept.What do we thinkthe level that idea of constructing manymany intervals.What happens to these manymany intervals?one last self assessment.What do we think?And I know it's just random guessing because it truly is 5149.It doesn't get any more random than that.Sodiscuss with your neighbors.What do we think? It is?It's kind of like your seal of approval.Yes. you're done.You've understood level. Focus on something else now oryou need to review the last few chapters where we've beentalking about level constantly.So what do we think?Look at thisand I'll show youthe results. So you see, I'm not lying.It doesn't get more random than that.Right?Is this enough evidence that there's random selection?Defin. I couldn't plan it any better.5050 between these two.So I'll give you one more chance.Try it out again.The one show the resultsdiscuss. Think about itlast time you'll see a level of interpretationIn generic terms. What happens if you have manyintervals approximately what 95% of the intervals.Do whatWhat do these, 95% of the intervals do?I'm curious to see the resultsso I'm gonna stop it and I will see it.How do we explain this?The end of the semesterWe've seen levels so many#####times. I can pull up homer 567.There's a level in every single one of these homeworksevery single one of them.Right? So there's something going on here.Is this right?No, this is not correct. You can always always alwayswrite an interpretation of the level before you even look atyour data before you even construct an interval because itdoes not allude to the one interval you have.It talks about the many intervals and how the manyintervals containyour population parameter. The many many intervals aregoing to contain that population parameter.So we don't include that.The reason why this method is reliable is because if we havemany intervals a high percentage of these intervals contain theparameter. That's whyI don't have to look at the data.I don't have to look at that interval to write theinterpretation at the level. The last time we see it, pleasereview before that exam because it's one of those keyinterpretations that we should understand.Okayand we'll stop here.Have a wonderful break. Please take some time todecompress.Be ready to review your interpretation of the levelbefore exam two.Uh huh.
Hello.It's thursday almost break almost.We have a homework due tonight at 11 59.Make sure you get it in. Uh We have some office hourstoday in person and remote. We have one hour of remotehours. Um Stop by.We're here to help. UmThis assignmentcovers a lot you know a lot of what we've been doing in thepast few weeks. So it's a good indication ofwhat you might want to focus on reviewing versus stuff thatyou've completely understoodAnd you can focus on something else.Um your drafts were due last night if you did not get it inand there is a good chunk of you who did not turn them in lastnight. You do have until today at noon.Well 1230 to get those um drafts in through canvas with aone point deduction after that you will not be getting creditfor the draft.Um If you don't turn in your draft through canvas it will notbe part of the peer review process.You will not get any feedback from your peers.The peer reviews are going to open at 12 45andyou can get those done before you take off for your break.Okay technically they're due next week on Tuesday but I wouldencourage you all to get them done before you start yourbreak. That way you can completely takea pause from stats to 50 for a week because there really isnothing to do next week. If you complete the peer reviewsbefore you take off for a break. Okay get those done,invest an hour, get them done and then that's#####it you're done.Don't procrastinate. Be good to your future selves.Okay? And I also encourage you that while you're here, you'realso good to your future selves. You're investing an hour and ahalf. Work through the ideas thatwe're working through in lecture.Hence you don't have to reinvest this time later on after thebreak because you're doing it now.Okay. Otherwise it's double timeand that's one thing that we often lack time.Okay so make sure that you're here invested.Work through the problems with me, understand ask questionsabout regression focused. I know it's hard in these daysto stay focused, butt focused, get something out of it.You're here for an hour and a half.Don't invest this time yet again afterthe lecture. Okay, highly highly recommendthatumnext week we have no labs, no lectures, no office hours otherthan m right fellows have a few office hours on Tuesday toanswer any peer review questions you might have.But other than that nothing. No new homework opens tonight.We truly want you to take a break,decompressed for a week before you come back and wrap up thesemester and do a strong finish. Okay,Shall we go through regression.So a few things we need to wrap up, we won't get through it alltoday. But that's okay.So regression is looking at the relationship between twoquantitative variables. we have to have two quantitativevariablesand their order for us to get a visual, which is always thefirst step in data analysis, understand your data, visualizethe data, explore the data in order for us to get a visual ofthis#####relationship between these two variables.We're going to use a scatter plot.And as you've noticed by now we are almost at the end of thesemester. Every time we have a graphicaldisplay, we have to include some sort of commentary about what wesee in the graphical display. You did that with? Em right.You have your side by side box plot in your draft.You needed to provide something for the readers.What is it that they should focus on in that plot.You did the same thing with the hissed a gram of thedifferences. Right.What was so meaningful about that, hissed a gram.What are positive differences? What are negative differences?Why are you looking at differences Because of thedependent scenario?So the same thing goes with the scatter plot.When we have our scatter plot, we're going to be conveying theidea of a form? What type of relationship in terms of itsform do we see between these two variables? What is thedirection? What is the strength? And are there any outliers thatyou think? Might there be any outliers? So always use thatvague language because we don't give you the tools to decidewhether something is an outlier or not.We want to hear your perspective of that.Okay,now, when it comes to the strength for your description itis subjective, What is it that you consider strong versus weakversus moderately strong or moderately weak.But then there's also a summary that quantifies that strengthand that's your correlation coefficient.The magnitude of that correlation coefficientis the strength of the association.The closer that magnitude is to#####one,the stronger the association, the closer than magnitude is tozero the weaker the association. That correlation coefficientalso provides a positive in the negative direction of theassociationand then everything we do as you'll see today will have thisvery long formulasthat students will gravitate and want to use however our providesall these key components if you know where to look.So regression is one of those um topics that really relies onnavigating and knowing your way around our output becauseeverything is there, as long as you know where to look as you'llsee today. Okay, so from this regressionoutput we can pick up the linear relationship, themodel, the equation of the line, here's my y interceptand that also provides the slope for mefrom the output.You can get this equation of the line, we went through how tocalculate that equation of the line with formulas but you canjust pick it up from here. Okay,sounds good,what else are we going to do?We're going to dive deep into this correlation coefficient.Rbecause it provides this very nice idea for us.So with regression there's a lot of things you can do.The first four things is what we called descriptive regression.And we'll wrap that up today. The last three things is theinference part of regression, and we'll work through one ofthose. One of the three ideas.There? Only one. Okay, are we readyour square? Let's think about this measure.So we want to pay attention for like two minutes so that weunderstand this r. Square valuebecause this is such a key value,#####Such a key component andwe love it so much because it has a very nice intuitiveinterpretation. Okay,so fact is monthly rent prices are different,right? Even if you were to look at the same apartment size,you will get variability in monthly rent prices.Not every single apartment has the same price.We want to understand the variability of our response,which is monthly rent prices.If I only had eight listings and Ionly had information about eight monthly rent prices.These prices are going to vary. I'm not gonna get the same rentprice, gonna be variability there.If I wanted to predictthe monthly rent price for someone who's interested inrenting an apartment, what would be my best guess based on thefact that I only have access to eight listings in their monthlyrent price.What would you suggest as the best guessif you have quantitative data,only eight observations and you want to make a prediction usingthese eight observations that only include monthly rentprices, what would you predict?What would be a good educated guess?No waythe average, right. If all I had was access to eightobservations and I want to make a prediction using these eightquantitative observations, my best guess is going to be theaverageand I would make the same prediction for everyone.Just the average.The whole point of regression, though, is to understand whatcontributes to this variability in your response.And if I only have access to my response, I'm going to be makingthe same prediction all the time,but we know that prices of apartments, rent, prices varyand that variability is due#####to many factors, some of it isapartment size. What are other factors thatcontribute to the variability in monthly rent prices? What do youthink?I'm sure you all look for apartments? Right.As college students, that's part of being a student, you have tofind a place to live. Right.So what factors contribute to the variability wesee in monthly rent prices? What have you noticed?Location? Right. Location is definitely a factorthat contributes to that, what elsesize,number of bedrooms,what elseamenities? Right.The age of the building?Right. Very old buildings versus newbuildings,parking? Does they have parking or not, that contributes to thevariability and monthly rent prices.So there's all these factors that contribute to thevariability of monthly rent prices.And my job is to understand that variability of monthly rentprices. But the way I'm going tounderstand it is by selecting one of the many factors becauseof simple regression. So I only have one variable thatI can use. Right?So when we look at this variability of our monthly rentprice is really composed of two things is composed by thevariability that is explained by the variable you'veselectedand the variability that's left unexplained because it's due toother factors. So in our case the variabilityof monthly rent priceis some portion of that is explained by the apartment sizeand some other portion is left unexplained because it's due tolocation amenities, age of the building.Does it have parking or not? So this r square quantity is suchan important measure for us because it has a very niceintuitive idea.It is a quantity between zero and 1#####which implies it is aproportionand it is a proportion of the variability in the response thatis actually explained by the one variable you selected.So if this proportion is closer to one,what does that tell you about the explanatory variable youselected?Is it explaining a lot of that variability.Yeah, there's a very few variability left.Unaccounted for by that explanatory variable.If that correlation coefficient, if that r square value is closerto zero,then that explanatory variable you selected to understand thevariability of that response is not that great,right? It's not accounting for a lot of that variability.It's not explaining a lot of that variability.So let's look at this value where we find it in our outputand how do we interpret it?So where are we gonna find this? R square quantity?It's part of the coefficients outputand right under it are some numerical summaries,some of which are your art score quantities, one is the adjustedR square. We never use this one.The adjusted is used when you have a model that has more thanone explanatory variable because you can think of creating amodel that includes all your explanatory variables.Right? If you had access to that and it would be a very goodmodel. But then you have to adjust theart square because in your square quantity would be oneand that can be. So you need to adjust it.So that's what the adjusted R square is for.So we don't use it because we're using simple regression.So our our square isthe multiple are square. There it is.So what does this#####number tell you? In our example, itsuggests that 67.24of the variation. In my response is actuallyexplained by the relationship it has with the explanatoryvariable.In other words, 67.24% of thevariation in monthly rent price, which iswhat we are trying to understandis explained by the relationship it has withapartment size,67%of the variation we see in these monthly rent prices is actuallydue to the fact that you're looking at different apartmentsizesAbout 67%.The other 32% is left unexplained that other32% is due to location amenities, theage of the building, whether it has a park parking or not, theother 32% is not accounted for with this model.Does that make sense in terms of our art square, such a beautifulnumber and we love it so much because of this intuitive ideathat alludes to how good of a model you have.Is it a good model? Did you pick the right explanatory variable?Well, let's look at this Art square quantity and see whetherwe did select an appropriate explanatory variable of the manywe could have chosengood.Now, if we have the R square quantity, can we compute thecorrelation coefficient? Rwhat do you think?Probably right. Because we're not always gonnahave access to data, especially at an exam setting.Hence we can't just use the core function to compute thiscorrelation coefficient. So we have to use output in onepossibility is to use the r square quantity to compute ourcorrelation coefficient. It is going to be the squareroot of our square.I do want to add to this the plus or minus to remindourselves to#####always checkis it a positive direction or is it a negative direction? Andwe're gonna check using either the sign of the slopeor the direction of the scatter plot or inin our case, what type of direction do we haveslope is positive. We looked at the scatter plotand we said it was a positive direction.So we do have a positive directionpositive correlation coefficient because that positive negativegives you the direction and then square root of r R squarequantity.Always multiple are square. Never adjusted .6724.So we getOur Correlation Coefficient .82.So from the r square quantity we can get the correlationcoefficient,which is what you would do on a homework or an exam where wewant to provide some output. That provides lots of pieces ofinformation rather than the direct output of the correlationfunction. Okay, yes,that's still white.So our square measures. So when do we use our squareversus our both are alluding to the strength of the associationbetween x and y. Are square provides themagnitude provides the strength and it also provides thedirection.That's what the correlation coefficient gives us from forour model,Our square howevergives you that I concept but without the positive and thenegative. But it has a very niceinterpretation because your art square quantity is from 0 to 1and it's a proportion. The closer that proportion is tooneimplies that your explanatory variable is doing a very goodjob at explaining all the variability you see in yourresponse.Which is by definition what we are trying to do withregression.Why are we using regression tolook at the relationship#####between your X and your Y.Hmmdirection,squarestrength.So the R. R correlation are always givesyou a direction which is not what you get from our square.What you get from our square. Is this nice interpretation thatalludes to the original goal of regression which is tounderstand the variability of your response by including amodel that has many explanatory variables.Good.Last things about descriptive regression.Before we move on toinference,nonlinear relationshipsalways visualize your data are will always create a linearmodel for you. Even if the relationship is notlinear. So as step one, you always needto visualize explore your data. You did that with em.Right, you're gonna continue to do that provide the rightgraphical displays to understand your data before you conductyour analysis.Outliers, outliers could influence your regressionline.It could be quite influential. So we don't give you the toolsto understand outliers. Um We simply want you to commenton whether you have outliers or not, potential outliers in yourdata set or not?But they could steer your analysis in one direction oranotherand then the other one is dangers of extrapolating.When we do regression analysis,you can only make predictions within the range of X.If you make predictions outside the range of X, then you don'treally know what the china is going to continue to be.That's different analysis, but not with regression.With regression. It really is only for the rangeof X. Otherwise you're extrapolatingand then you have to do further analysis.Okay, so here's an exampleof extrapolation. What's gonna happen in the21 56 Olympics for sprintersshould be sprint, nice spring.What's gonna happen?We#####have winning timesFor sprinters and then eight and then year not eight year.And they have records for the Olympics.Up to this was up to 1996. They gave you an r squaredquantity for males in our square quantity for females.And what did they decide to do extend the line? So that in theyear 21,which is what they're predicting something great is gonna happen.Finally, women and men are gonna run just as fast.There's not going to be a difference,but why do we stop there? What would be even a better headline?What is it?Huh?With women actually run faster than men? Furthermore, whenwe can do winning time inzero seconds. Right?Furthermore winning a race innegative time. Right? Why stop at the year 2156. Right.So this isan example of extrapolation. You don't extrapolate.You don't know what's gonna happen.You don't have information for that.Okay. There's no need why you need tostop at 21 56. You can even make a betterheadline if you actually continue further into the futurebased on their analysis. Okay.The other one is dangerous of combining groupsinappropriately.So, a school district wanted to understand what the optimalduration of study is for students to achieve satisfactoryresults.So they asked teachers various classes to do a survey amongtheir students and they plotted the results of the survey thatlooked at the preparation hours and then their final percentage.What do you noticenegative direction?Right? Strong relationship.It looks. Okay.Right.What would be a message based on this plotstudy? Lessperform better?Does that make sense?Should I be advertising that to my students study less? You'llperform better.Yes.Quality#####versus quantity. That's what I should be.Advertising quality of study versus quantity of study.So what's going on,what do we thinkthey did ask teachers? Various subjects.So, of course, some subjects require more versus less.Right. So, if you actually look at eachsubject,you see why you see this type of relationship.It doesn't make sense because the data was combinedinappropriately. There's confounding factors herethat don't really highlight what's going on.You should be analyzing this data separately by subject.Okay, so that's what we mean by Simpson's paradox.And then the last thing is even if the correlation is exactlyonewhich is unheard of. But even if you cannot say thatX is causing Y to occurthe different analysis and conversation is very hard toprovide a convincing argument for.Okay.Okay.And that isit for descriptive analysis.Shall we practice it? Going back to our long eyelashes? We havethree questions you get to work through and click in.Think about what we've seen so far.Check. Did I understand these lastitems. Do I know where to look in ouroutput to come up with these ideas? One less thing to worryabout after the break in terms of studying for that exam.If not ask raise your hand,ask away.Try it out.You're here. And that's that time check.Do I know how to answer these questions If it were to appearon homework eight that I consume through the hallmarkor one less thing to study for that exam which is intwo weeks if you don't count. Thanksgivingthere's a clicker for the correlation.Be good to your future selves. There's not much time#####left inthe semesterare you justso what's the correlation between these two quantitativevariables.How are we gonna find this correlation?Have your correlation coefficient? Go ahead and clickin decide which one matches your core correlation coefficientbased on the clickers.So we want the correlation between these two quantitativevariables, which implies we want the correlation coefficient.RIf we don't have the data set in front of us, we can't use thatcore function to compute this correlation coefficient like wewould in lab after the break.So where are we going to get that correlation coefficient? Rlucky for us this our output provides the R square and we'renever going to use the adjusted R squarebecause that implies that we have more than one explanatoryvariable. If we had more than oneexplanatory variable we would be using that adjusted R square butthat's not our case. We have simple regression.One explanatory variable. We go with the multiple aresquareplus or minus square root of our square.Is it going to be positive or negative?The slope will determine the sign based on the slope we havea positive direction. So it's gonna be a positiveassociation. You can look at the slope.You can also look at the scatter plot.6069giving meA correlation coefficient of.779.and only about 60% of us got that.The other common answer was aand a is your R square quantity, which is not the correlationcoefficient.Should I add units to this quantity?No, the correlation coefficient is a unit less quantity.No units.If I were to change all of my data and convert it tomilligrams, I will still get#####the same correlation coefficient of.779. No units.Okay.Ready to try the next one.What is this asking for?This is an interpretation ofare squareSo we can pick up our square from the output.There it is 60.69% of the variationin the response is explained by the relationship thisresponse has with the explanatory variable.My response is whateyelash with lengthand my explanatory variable isthe eye withSo 60.69% of the variations I have inthese responses in these eyelash lengths that I have in my datais actually explained by the fact that we're looking atdifferent umeyes of different sizes.The rest is left unexplained by this factor.Some other thing is explaining the restgood.And finally the last oneclicker.What do we think about this one? Giraffes?The eye with of giraffes um of a giraffe was measured and foundto be 4.08 cm.Should we use this model to predict the eyelash length forgiraffes?Yes or no. Would it be valid? We can alwaysdo it right but is it valid?It's a formula. So we can always plug stuff intothe formula and outcome some sort of predicted value but isthat predicted value meaningful or valid for the analysis?Go ahead and discusswith your neighbors please.And that's the time that you're in herebe good to your future selves. You're here for an hour,understand regression. One less thing that you have toworry about for that exam that's coming up soon.The hardest part was getting here.Now that you're herestay focused for an hour.You already did the hard part which issnowing and you're here.Now let's gain something out of it.Okayso can#####we do thiswhen we make predictions? We should always be makingpredictions withinthe range of our explanatory variable.So if you look at the scatter plot, is this outside the rangeor inside the range of my explanatory variable?It is outside the range. So hence we cannot use thismodel to make predictions for giraffes.So we're not gonna use it because it is outside the rangeof my explanatory variable which is i with this isextrapolating an example of extrapolatinggood.We are done with the descriptive side of regression.Now comesthe inference.The new stuff for a lot of us.So let's pretend for a second that instead of just having asample of observations, I actually had apopulation of observations. The entire population data set.What would my scattered plot look like?I wouldn't just have eight xy combinations.I would have for every single listing in the city.I would have all of those xy combinations.So my scatter plot would have lots and lots and lots and lotsof lots of dots.If I actually had population data, I could fit a linearmodel through that population dataand that linear model would bethe true regression line.The true population regression linewhich only exists ifI had population data, which I don't I always work with sampledatabut that line does exist.What have we done so far with inference? We take our sampleand a statistic and we always want to learn about thepopulation parameter.The same thing applies to regression is just a little bittrickier. But the same idea appliesif we actually had population data we would have aregression model#####for this population data.So this one requires population data.What we have access to thoseis sample data.So my best guess as to what that population model might be is theone I create using my sample. So this one only requiressample data.So it's analogous to having a sample and finding a statisticthat's estimating the population parameter.That is unknown.So this true line is that population idea that does existif you had population data and your best guess is based onsample data, which is that sample version of a regressionline.Now that population data, the population regression line ismade up of Parameters. So beta zero is your true.Why interceptfor the population of interest.We don't have population data. So we always use our statistic,B0 is your statistic which will vary from sample to sample.Because if I had different observations, I'll create adifferent regression line. So this is my sample, yinterceptand it variesfrom sample to samplejust like every statistic.The same thing happens with slope.Beta one is my parameter and that's my populationslope. Which requires population datain order to know its quantity. And the best guess for thatpopulation slope is my sample slope.My statistic.So we still have this idea of parameter versus statistic isjust a little bit different from what we are used tobecausewe have an equation of the line that we're estimating basically.Okay, using the sample.Now when we do inference, where are we gonna go with this?We are going to assess if we have a linear relationshipbetween the X and the Y. The explanatory variable in theresponse.#####If we're assessingLinking it back to homework seven.The last question, if we are assessing a claim,what type of inference method should we usea test of an interval?When you read those options on question nine of homework seven,if you're assessing a claim, what method are you going to beusing a test or an interval?A test? Right. So when we assess if we have alinear relationship, we're going to conducta hypothesis test.We're also going to be providing intervals around our estimates.After all this data. This regression line, Thissample regression line is based on a sample data and if I had adifferent sample, I would have a different sample line.So instead of just providing a predicted quantity, like we'vebeen doing, we're gonna construct intervals around ourpredictions and talk about the different types of intervals wecan have.And then the last thing is assumptions.That's always the last thing you do in regression because youneed the model.So let's start with the first one.Shall wetake a break before we start?Yes,two minute break, stretch. Come back.Focus for the last part. So you have one less thing toreview after thanksgiving.You don't wannaaccumulate things.Okay, shall we start?Yes,So we're gonna conduct a testwhich means we have to have some sort ofMeasure of variability. Okay, so going back toway back, Chapter two, a standard deviation.That standard deviation measured the average distance of anobservation to the mean, a typical observation to the meat.That's what that standard deviation provided for us.It turns out that regression also has its own standarddeviation,but it's not the same#####as what we had before.So that standard deviation is looking at the average size ofthe residual on average. How far away are your observedvalues from the predicted? If you notice all of these lines,horizontal lines are your residualsfrom Tuesday residuals areyour errors.Some of these residualsare quite large, we were way off for some um predictions.Some of them are very small. We were almost there some mighteven be zero right on target. Right? So we want to get a senseof the average size of these residuals, Some are big, someare small. What is the average sizeroughly? How far off is your estimate from that observedquantity?So that's what we're gonna call the standard deviation for theregression. So it is an average size whichmeans it's going to be adding thingsanddividing by a total right? That's how you find average toadd things up and divide by a totalby definition. That's how you do an average,it is the average size of the residual the error term.How do we find each error term? We look at the observation.How far away is that observation fromthe predicted value?Here's your observation and here's your predictedand you're measuring the distance between those two.The residual observed minus predicted.And you're doing that for every observation because you want toget that average size of these residuals.So here's the second one.Why? To how far away it is from its predicted quantity.Let's just go to the last one.The last observation, how far away it is fromit's predicted quantity.Now, if we leave it as is some#####of these errors are positive,some are negative because sometimes we overestimatesometimes we underestimate. So if we were to just computethese errors and add them up, we would getzero things canceled out. What's her quick fix?Square?We've always done that.So let's square everything.And if we're squaringwe need to unscrew air so we need to take the square root ofitand nowthe sample sizeIt is true that to find an average you have to divide by atotal. However our total is not goingto be in, it is going to be N -2.We're losing 2° of freedom.The reason for that is every time we include an estimate intoour measurements we need to compensate for introducing errorby taking away a degree of freedom.Where are we introducing estimates.When we find white hatWe're using B0 which is a statistic.And we're using B1 which is also a statistic.Both B0 and B one are estimating Parameters.They're estimating beta zero and beta one.So because we're estimating two parameters,We're introducing error into our calculation, we compensate bytaking away degrees of freedom. So the reason why it's N -2 isbecause we're estimating two parameters when we use white hatbest wayif we had non simple regression and introduced another one wewould need to compensate and provide the appropriate degreesof freedom there. Okay,so where are we gonna find this quantity because it's not gonnabe fun to do this with the formula, which you do have onyour formula card, which when we asked the students always wantto use the formula but you can use ourthis quantity#####is right here.The residual standard air,this is your s your standard deviation for the regression.The averagesizeof the residual.You're swhat does it mean? What's the interpretation of it?Well, a residual is measuring how far away is the predictedfrom the observe. And we're getting a sense ofwhat is that average size of the residual.So we would estimate that the observe whyIt's about126point62 cents away fromthe predicted why measuring that distance between the observedand the predicted on average? As you did see some of theseresiduals were large, others were small.But on average this is how far your observed quantities arefrom the predictedabout this much away.And this standard erroris what we get to useto findthe the standard error for our statistic.So let's do that, shall weone step closer.Is there a significant relationshipmeaning slope? What happens if if your slope is zero?What happens if your slip is zero?Flat line doesn't matter what X is?It's not related to why it's not helping you explain why?Right. So is there a significantrelationship status quo? There is no relationship, your flat,your line is flatalternative. There is a relationship, you'readding some sort of slope to this line.X. Is helping you make betterpredictions because it is related to your why?So when we are asking assessing about the significantrelationship between the two variables you've selected, wewant to test theories about the slope.H not is going to suggest scatter points.No relationship. It doesn't matter what X.Is why it's not getting any better in terms of thepredictions, because there's no relationship alternative.Here's one possible#####relationship.A positive relationship. It could be negative, right? Itcould be a little weaker, a little bit more strong.But there is a relationshipbecause it's quantitative data. What type of test that we'regoing to use?T test? So, let's compute our test statistic.We're gonna use a T. Test and we're also going toconstruct a confidence interval. C.F zeros in there or not.Shall we do it?It's not too bad. So let's work through it.It is going to be a T. It is going to measure how faraway is our statistic, which is our sample slopefrom the null value, which happens to be zero.Most of the time. Sometimes you might have toadjust it divided bythe standard errorof that slope.I'm not even gonna show you the formula for the standard air.It is on the formula card. It is very convoluted more thanI would like, but it does use that sample standard deviationfor the regression, but I'm not even gonna show it to youbecause you'll see it all comes from our output.Okay,if H that is true, we are going to be using a T.Distribution how many degrees of freedom?Simple Regression and -2.We're estimating two things. We have to adjust the degrees offreedom accordinglyAnd -1 were always only estimating sigma.So that's why it was only one. But now we're estimating twothings.So let's conduct our test.Here we go.Is there a significant relationshipbetween our x apartment size and rymonthly rent price for this population of listings in thecity. In other words, status quo isgonna suggestNo relationship, beta one equal zero.There#####is no relationship between these two variables in thispopulationalternative is gonna suggestthere is a relationship, so it should be not equal to zero.So beta one representsthe population slopebetween apartment sizeand monthly rent priceforthe populationof listingsin this particular city, whatever city it is.And this is where you want to pay attention for the next threeminutes because it will save you a headache later on.So now that we have our h not an Rh a let's go ahead and performthe test,right, So let's perform the testt how far away is the one from the null value, which in ourcase is zero and we're gonna divide that by the standarderror of our statistic.We are testing theories aboutthe slope.Hence when we look at the our output,we're going to focus onthe slope.Okaywe're testing theories about the slope.Let's focus there.So b. One is your sample slope.So there's my sample slope. There's B 1.8303.How far away it is from zero.And I'm gonna measure this with the right standard air which isright here.There's my standard air. That's why I didn't show you theformula. But it is in the formula card.If you're curious about how it was computed.So it's .2366.Furthermore. What do you see in the nextcolumn?The T. Value3.509. There's your t.value right there.T. Test statistic valuefurthermore. What do you see in the nextcolor?Very weird labeling. We haven't seen that before butit does a probability greater than absolute value of T.What do you think that meansthe p value?Right? So this last column hereis your p valuebut it is greater#####than the absolute value of your teststatistic. Which implies it isa two sided P valley. Always always two sided.Can never go around that. Always two sided.So with that let's evaluate the p value and clickinevaluatewhat do we do when we evaluate a P value,we quantify the evidence against the null.That's it. That's all we do when weevaluate.So there's my P value. How much evidence do I haveagainst the north?Everything comes from our output.We don't even have to use shiny app anymore.All right. It's all there everything islisted as long as you know where to look.If you don't know where to look, you're gonna go straight to theformula card and you're gonna get all these formulas and thenyou're gonna spend a lot of time trying to put those piecestogether when it's all just in the art output.Okay. Sothat something will practice in the next lab.So how much evidence evaluate when we evaluate? The only thingwe want is for you to quantify the evidence against the null.So how much evidence do we havestrong evidence?P value isBetween 5% and1%. So we have strong evidence.Good. That's it.That's all we want. When they evaluatewhat's the secondidea that gets lumped in to evaluate,write a conclusionright. We started with the claimlooking at whether there is a relationship between X and Y andthis population.What are we gonna suggestbased on the data?It seems like we do have a relationship between X and Y.In this populationbased on the data? We have evidence to support this ideanotice that I don't say#####based on the data.Yes.There is a relationship but I or I don't say there is arelationship.It's always very ambiguous right? Based on the data.This is what I can suggest.I might be wrong but this is what I will suggest based on thedatabecause I was readingdrafts yesterday and I keptreading very strong statements yes.Even though your P value is very very very very very tiny.We're still not proving H A is trueright based on the data. This is what I'm suggesting.Okay,so be careful with your wording. Even if your P value is veryvery very very small.So there's my conclusion.If I were to construct a confidence interval for myslope,Do you think this interval is going to contain zeroclick indiscuss with your neighborthink about what we've done in the past in terms of intervalsand testing in the connection between these two.What do we think?Will this interval contain the value of zeroclickinglink everything together that we've done put it all togetherbefore we construct the interval.And that would be the last thing we do.Let's construct an intervallots of us are saying no,we are supporting that alternative.And the alternative is suggesting that there is arelationship meaning that slope is something else other thanzero. So when we construct thisinterval to estimate the slope, that interval probably doesn'thave zero. Let's confirm.Shall welet's construct an interval.What is always in the middle of the intervalyour point estimate your statistic.So right in the middle of this interval is my point estimateof my population slope.My statistic.My sample slopeto that I'm gonna add#####and subtracta margin of error which is half the width of the interval.And that margin of error is composed of two things.The standard air and a T. Star.The T. Star is always going to comefrom the T. Table.At least the tools I've given you is always from the table andwe're gonna use and minus two degrees of freedom.Ready to construct the interval.That's the last thing we'll doand thenstart our breakafter we do the period.So let's construct this interval.B one plus or minus T. StarStandard error of B one.The most common error.T star T value. Are these the same thing?No. So my T.Star will always come from the table.So find for me the T. Star quantity.How many degrees of freedomfor regression? Always simple regression, simple regression,which is us always and minus two.We have eight listings so our degrees of freedomsixsample sizes eight. So let's put it all together,find for me that T. Star quantity.And remember the standard error is right here.There's a standard errorofmy slope.So .2366.What did y'all get for that? T star2.44seven.So right in the middle is my statistic to that I'm adding andsubtracting a margin of errorof.57896 which gives me an intervalthat hopefully does not contain zero and it doesn'tfor every increase inapartment size, we expect to see an increase in monthly rentprice that ranges between 0.25, 25 cents and a dollar and41 cents.RightBased on this 95% confidence interval.Good.And one last thing,last last. Let's see how we do.We've been working with intervals for a while.This is the last time#####we're going to interpret aninterpretation of the level last timeculmination.Do we think the following statement is correct? Whathappens if we construct many many manyintervals?Is this correct?Is the last time.So really think about it.Read it carefully.This is like a check. Yes, I understand confidencelevels. We've been doing it for so long.I finally nailed it. I got it.Or I need to review that. Very important concept.What do we thinkthe level that idea of constructing manymany intervals.What happens to these manymany intervals?one last self assessment.What do we think?And I know it's just random guessing because it truly is 5149.It doesn't get any more random than that.Sodiscuss with your neighbors.What do we think? It is?It's kind of like your seal of approval.Yes. you're done.You've understood level. Focus on something else now oryou need to review the last few chapters where we've beentalking about level constantly.So what do we think?Look at thisand I'll show youthe results. So you see, I'm not lying.It doesn't get more random than that.Right?Is this enough evidence that there's random selection?Defin. I couldn't plan it any better.5050 between these two.So I'll give you one more chance.Try it out again.The one show the resultsdiscuss. Think about itlast time you'll see a level of interpretationIn generic terms. What happens if you have manyintervals approximately what 95% of the intervals.Do whatWhat do these, 95% of the intervals do?I'm curious to see the resultsso I'm gonna stop it and I will see it.How do we explain this?The end of the semesterWe've seen levels so many#####times. I can pull up homer 567.There's a level in every single one of these homeworksevery single one of them.Right? So there's something going on here.Is this right?No, this is not correct. You can always always alwayswrite an interpretation of the level before you even look atyour data before you even construct an interval because itdoes not allude to the one interval you have.It talks about the many intervals and how the manyintervals containyour population parameter. The many many intervals aregoing to contain that population parameter.So we don't include that.The reason why this method is reliable is because if we havemany intervals a high percentage of these intervals contain theparameter. That's whyI don't have to look at the data.I don't have to look at that interval to write theinterpretation at the level. The last time we see it, pleasereview before that exam because it's one of those keyinterpretations that we should understand.Okayand we'll stop here.Have a wonderful break. Please take some time todecompress.Be ready to review your interpretation of the levelbefore exam two.Uh huh.
